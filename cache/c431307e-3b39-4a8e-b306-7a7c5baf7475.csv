If 2 people in a room 2 towels would seem appropriate!,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Clean and spacious room and reasonable good breakfast provided.

Free Wifi for only miserable 30 mins! Had to pay around 8 pounds per 24 hours parking but cannot find a lot after midnight! Reception wanted to charge me 10 pounds to check in 1 hour early so preferred to wait even though room was available!",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"The receptionist was very rude for us and she was rushing and did not listen to our requests.
When I asked about water she told us to look around for water filters.
When I asked about shuttle Services she just gave me shuttle schedule to read it.
Those are fine, not offensive but very rude and mean.
They should show hospitality to everyone equally, not according to other appearances",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Very clean, very comfortable and food in the restaurant exceeded expectations, the only complaint was that after 25 minutes i had to hunt down my dessert. 
Would definitely stay there again, perfect for an early flight and just £3 on the regular shuttle.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Watch out for parking costs, not included in nightly rate.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
Good location with a regular shuttle bus running to both terminals,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"On my 1st night while working at the desk in my room my i was bitten a multitude of times by fleas.  
I did complain the next day and was moved immediately but the staff did not appear to be shocked!",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Great value for money. Booked a family room, a king bed and two twin beds. No fridge or hair drier.  Food was ok, decently priced.  Watch for kids menu and breakfast for free.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
Occupied. No soap in the shower. Won’t be back,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
Nice Hotel - Not sure I like the trend toward charging for all the extras like parking etc but I guess that is the way the budget hotels and companies seem to be going. Overall a very clean and well decorated hotel,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"The price of a family room was very good for the time of year. One double bed and 2 singles in the family room. Room size was big- could easily accommodate another couple of single beds. Basic room- no fridge,  iron/ironing board, no hairdryer even- basically nothing that was not stapled down. I assume you could get a hairdryer if you needed one. Cafe/bar was large and food was tasty enough for dinner with meal deals making it quite affordable. Breakfast was standard and covered hot and cold buffet food for 9pounds per adult with 2 children (15 and under) per adult, free, which made it good value for breakfast. Convenient airport shuttle from Bay 8 at North terminal. ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Ideal for airport stopover. Used shuttle bus to airport which was fine, took about 20min. Not sure how it is when busy. I was 5.15 am. ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
很接近机场。新酒店。,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Very satisfied for my stay in Travelodge! Fast check in and check out, good customer service, very nice buffet breakfast, big and comfortable bed.Overall it's pleasant experience to stay at Travelodge! ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"They could not find my booking! Check in took over 30 min!
Answer: ""it takes as long as it takes"" not a very forthcoming statement!!",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Renovation of hotel rooms and supporting facilities has raised the bar. Can be a little noisy as customers leave or arrive from the airport.

Despite this I would say good value for money.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Free wifi only for 30 minutes what was not mentioned during reservation
  
",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"The problem I had was the inability to make contact with the outside world The hotel has no telephones - none in the rooms, no public phone !!!  I had to borrow a cellphone from the receptionist to make a (local only) call. Fortunately I have a contact in the UK. But for a hotel at a major airport, this failure  is amazing !! Like all ex-pat travellers I need to contact home  - I was not in England for pleasure and regular communications are vital. 

We are all supposed to use the Internet these days and I did bring my tablet computer but unfortunately the hotel's wi-fi was too feeble to get a connection. 

This is not the first of similar complaints I have had about other UK hotels. British hoteliers would do well to understand that not everyone in the world lives in the UK. A hotel near to an international airport should have worked out by now that we ex-pats and foreigners use airport hotels but we need to call telephones in overseas countries.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
Shuttle services right on spot; super friendly staff and great food!! Really enjoyed my stay!!,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
We stayed on a long layover on Gatwick. We were greeted by friendly accommodating staff pretty late in the night. The room was clean and the hotel and shuttle were convenient to Gatwick.,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"There was mold growing on the drain in the bathtub, and the room smelled very bad. ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"The experience was incredible, nice atmosphere, delicious  food and lovely staff.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"It’s clean and staff is lovely. However, the temperature of the room was difficult to control since the front desk controls the main.  Windows don’t open and our room was too hot!! On both occasions we’ve stayed, the water was only slightly above lukewarm. Other than the room & water temperatures, it was a comfortable stay and good value. ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
This place was quite ok. I didn’t realise when I booked it that I would have to get the bus there from the N terminal. Once you find the bus stop it is ok. Good breakfast.,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Came in to eat breakfast ( paid for it ), but was met with big suspicions - they thought I am from the street or maybe homeless and came to steal their English breakfast? One of the lead chef's asked me if I was finished when I just started breakfast, very rude. ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Excellent stay. Extremely helpful team, good facilities, clean decent sized rooms.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Not even a tissue or a glass available in room, however tea/coffee making is. Location is great for airport and check-in/out very quick and easy. ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Very close to Gatwick airport for a one night stay before an early international flight & an airport bus picking up every 10 minutes. 
Beautifully clean and very friendly staff. ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Staff helpful, accommodating. Nice that hotel staff encouraged cafe staff to talk to visitors I was told.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Really great for an airport hotel. The room was clean, the mattress was very comfortable. The shower had great pressure, water could have been a bit hotter. The only drawback was that it’s low on amenities. There was no hair dryer, no phone in the room so no wake up call (in case the iPhone messed up the alarm). Wish it had it been a pod coffee maker instead of an older plastic kettle. But really, for the price it was very decent. Hotel shuttle was convenient although the shuttle signage at the airport is confusing with regards to this particular hotel. The shuttle also costs £3.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"In a good location but would need a taxi or take the shuttle bus  (free). Room was clean, beds awesome!  I would stay here again!",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
The location was perfect as it was .4 miles from the terminal. There is a shuttle that runs from the terminal to the hotel but costs 3 pounds each way.  The room was comfortable and bathroom was clean.  The staff was friendly and I will recommend and stay here again.,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
rooms was clean - stayed one night .Breakfast was terrible ,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"It’s not far from airport, but can’t walk. You need to take hotel bus at stop 9. Shuttle bus will service every 15 mins. It cost you 3 pound per trip. Will drop you or pick up you at hotel front door. 
Hotel facility is good , bed is new and comfortable. But bathroom and cup a little dirty. Rest is very good ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Pros - good shuttle service to the gatwick airport only 3 pounds 
Good breakfast 

Cons - No Phone in the Room, so to contact customer service you have to come  down from the 5th floor room
Less Towels
Soap in box the system is not good , wash basin soap was empty 
",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Clean, safe, basic and close to the airport.  Reasonable lounge for food and drinks. Counter staff less than helpful when checking in.  Had booking number but company that booked mispelled name - still not sure with booking number why would lead to such a delay in checking in (40 minutes).",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
Easy access to Gatwick. Clean. Flexible staff.,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Who want only sleep over night and morning has another flight, is this good location. By bus only 3-4 minutes. ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"I stayed here for an evening while waiting for a flight.  The room was large, clean and equipped.  The on site restaurant/bar had a good selection of drinks and the food was good. This isn't The Ritz, but for the price, I would stay here again.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
Over an hour to order  and get  our 2 burgers.....very noisy....,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"£3 shuttle bus to airport, 15mnts",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"I was disappointed that the shuttle bus cost £3 per person per trip. A taxi would have been cheaper. Driver was grumpy in the evening and same driver in the morning was still grumpy. We were not informed in advance. 
Towels had a very unpleasant odour ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Close to airport, very basic but rooms clean. Bar and restaurant and bar on site 15-20 walk into small town centre.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"The reception staff gave me a warm welcome on my arrival at 01.00 hrs and the checking in procedure was quick and efficient. They and another member of staff were extremely helpful in directing me to my room on the 6th floor, including opening doors to help me go through with my holiday suitcase.  The morning receptionist was similarly helpful in ordering me a taxi. My room was very clean and well furnished but some of the facilities were out of order - I could only the shower would only",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
Good hotel but no free WiFi and rooms very stuffy as no windows to open ,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
The hotel was very clean staff where very friendly only down fall was paying for parking 16 pound a night is slightly expensive ,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"The room was exceptionally clean, and set up as a twin room, as we requested. It was a very good choice before an early morning flight the next day, and great value for money. ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
Convenient location. Clean room and beds. Excellent breakfast. Everything you can ask for over night stay. ,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"This hotel was dreadful! When we opened the door to enter our room we thought we had been given the wrong room and they were obviously planning to renovate it. The room had a bed and a chair ....... That's all. There was a tv on the wall but it was impossible to change channels as the remote didn't work. There was no soap, shampoo or any toiletries at all. The towels were so thin they were soaked before you were dry, the shower was difficult to turn on. There was no phone, no hairdryer and no stand to put the case on. After addressing these to the reception staff  who were very unhelpful I asked if I could have a stand to put my case on I was very rudely told, what's wrong with the floor, use that !! Alfie the person I spoke to at re epsilon was particularly rude and unhelpful as were the bar staff. I will never ever stay at another Travelodge after this experience",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
Comfortable and convenient.,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"The staff were nice and friendly. Very basic room. Only had a bed and a small desk, no other furniture. Not warm and welcoming. The bed was very comfortable though. We went to the restaurant for dinner and were told the food would be an hour wait, so we went next door to another hotel and had a delicious fish &  chips dinner in their lounge.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
no probs,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"I booked this hotel for an overnight staying due to the early flight departure. I arrived in the night at 22 PM, the hotel is 5 minutes with a bus (3 £ fee each way) from the Gatwick North Terminal.
Check in process was pretty straight forward. My room, however, was not properly insulated and I could hear the conversation of other guests outside. Furthermore, and more annoying,  there was a constant noise like some water leak from the floor above, which disturbed me all night long, not allowing to have a good sleep. Furthermore, and the reason of my main disappointment, was the breakfast. I have booked this hotel because I wanted to have a proper hot English breakfast before leaving, paying an additional booking fee (around 8.5 £) to get it included in the room rate, while in the morning it turned out that for some unknown kitchen problem,  it was not available, so I was forced to skip it and I was not even be asked if I would like to be refund for it since it was not provided.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
Easy access to Gatwick Airport and all you need for a 1 night stay if you have a late night flight in (as we did) or early morning flight. Breakfast was simple but filled pur bellies before our road trip that day.,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Everything else was very good but it was a bit disappointing that the Wifi only allowed 30 minutes free access. After that it was £3 for 24 hours.

Also had to pay for parking but I suppose that’s pretty standard.

The staff were friendly and helpful and there was a kettle in the room for tea and coffee which I always appreciate.  ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"I arrived very late to the hotel and also had a very early morning flight. The check-in process was so simple and easy. The receptionist was kind and professional. I received my room key card very fast. So I was able to go to my room and go to bed right away.

My room was comfortable and the bed was so clean and firm. The pillows were so clean and fresh. 

The soap dispenser in the bathroom was broken. That was the only issue. 

So for the price and location these are great reasons to stay in the hotel. ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
There is blood stain on the bedsheet & hairs on the toilet bowl. It is because we are checked in late and checked out early therefore we did not request to change room. ,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
Convenient from the airport. Simple. Has bar / cafe ,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"It’s close to the airport, and has a bed, unfortunately the iron they provided was dangerous to say the least but this was rectified quickly.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Good, clean, reasonably priced hotel for a Gatwick stopover",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Value for money,,, especially when you are in transit or catch morning flight but looking for cheap but good quality hotel! ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"The hotel is just two bus stops away from Gatwick North terminal but there isn't much else around the area. The room was very clean and spacious but I didn't know check-in time was 3pm so I had to wait at the bar for 3 hours. Also, wifi is only free for 30mins every 24 hours. I paid for 24hours of wifi then it stopped working after just 2 hours and for the rest of my stay, which was very annoying because I couldn't get work done. Their staff just said there was nothing they could do but wait, so I guess they don't have any in house tech support. They also didn't offer to give me a refund on the wifi. It's a nice place if you don't need wifi for work, or just staying for a short period of time like I did.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
For that price i expect the basics necessity to be working fine. The heater panel doesnt work and it on and off by itself throughout. The staff says that they can control it from their side i don't know how but the heater just turn on and off by itself. ,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"This hotel is furnished in the style of a hostel rather than a pleasurable place to relax and unwind. Facilities were fine, the room and the hotel in general were clean, it's close to the airport and, like several hotels in the area is served by several shuttle buses to and from the north and south terminals at Gatwick. The room I had was quite large and the bathroom had a deep bath. The bed was fine although the polyester in the sheets was noticeable. However the dinner I had was the most awful I've had in years. I ordered the steak and ale pie, peas and mash. The pie was contained one small piece of meat and two slices of mushroom and was encased in quarter inch thick pastry which was completely sodden by the internal gravy as well as the additional gravy on top. The mashed potatoes were dry and hard on the edges and bottom, as if left over from lunch and reheated on the plate, and there were less than a quarter of a cup of peas. The sticky toffee pudding was enjoyable.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
Parking very expensive. Checked into the room had not been cleaned and we had to change rooms. Bar area very untidy. Rubbish and food on the floor  tables piled with food plates and dirty glasses. Website said recent million pound update. When was that?,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Compared with the travel lodge I used to use some years ago, this was not the same standard.  The room and bathroom were not very clean.   The room itself was very comfortable and spacious.
",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
Great place to stay. Staff very friendly. However in order to get there from the airport you must use shuttle  (3£ cash) or cab (6£) even if it’s in a walking distance and you could see it from the airport. There is simply no direct walk path.  Don’t use Uber because they over charge at Gatwic (17£),Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"We had a flight in the morning so we chose to stay here and there was a bus in front of the hotel to the airport all day all night.

Quick checked-in and big room with a reasonable price
",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"I had to walk 50 mins to get to this hotel because the shuttle requires 4GBP in cash, which of course I didn't have. I watched the shuttle drive off empty from the airport to the hotel... what a ridiculous waste, the hotel should just have a free shuttle. And you only get 30 mins of free wifi before you have to pay for that as well... absurd.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
Close to airport and staff very helpful,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
Check out how much a taxi  costs to the airport costs before you book  Why is there apparently no shuttle bus ?,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
We enjoyed our stay; had a great stay and would recommend without reservation.,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Pros -everything was fine
Cons , very small cleaning issues with the room,more time needed to clean properly I recommend!
Staff were excellent especially in the circumstances with the Covid Virus to deal with.
Recomend hand sanitizer  stations should be available around all parts of hotel.
9/10,  well-done to all.

A short taxi or bus ride from Gatwick airport. Efficient and friendly staff throughout.,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Good nights stay for an early morning flight. Room clean and tide, good shower, breakfast was great.

All round top-hole.

The only niggle, and nothing to do with the hotel is the bus transfer to the terminals. £4 per person, so, 2 people £8, or if you go by taxi £6 for two.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"The staff were very nice, helpful however, for the price, some help with luggage for an older person would be welcome. Also only 30mins free wifi and then have to pay online rather than option to pay cash at recption. Ist, for the price and as all international hotels, Wifi could be expected to be free, even 1 hour for contact with eg relatives and there was no way I would use my card online, so I didn't bother. Staff were very kind and let me use their phone at no charge to let my 97yo friend I was to visit that I had arrived in the country and the time I would see her next day, as O had no UK phone card yet.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"The hotel is not directly at the airport so a shuttle is required. Room was clean and comfortable but very simple- no hair drier, tissues or fridge. 
Staff were absolutely amazing. ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Rooms are nice and spacious, very clean , breakfast was great , definitely would stay again ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Pre-booked a taxi - £6 to Gatwick North in 10 mins or a shuttle every 15 minutes for £4
Quiet, comfortable and has everything you need on site.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
Near to Gatwick Airport and the bus shuttle (£3/ way)run very frequent and on time btw airport n hotel. Bus stop right in front of the hotel lobby ,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
I hink the bus between the airport and the hotel should be included i the hotel price. It is not practical to have to pay while having to take care of the luggage! So inconvenient!,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda

"Comfortable stay nearby Gatwick airport, I used agoda points and got it for half price but even at full price it would be a good deal. ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Room was spartan but the bed comfortable and clean. The a/c was making a horrible noise when running . Reception said they’d send someone, but no one came. Food at the bar was excellent . No coat hangars or dresser to put items in or on. Other than that it was good. ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"excellent location.  Clean and well maintained room  with comfortable bed.   No glasses in bathroom but no doubt could have obtained if I had gone to  reception.  It's no frills but fine for overnight stay.
Surprisingly  quiet.  Would use again",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"I was surprised it was way better than expected maybe newly renovated or something but It was great including the breakfast, my only complaint was that I was never able to get through the phone to talk to somebody. ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda

"Good value, near to Gatwick - with reliable shuttle service ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
A perfect place to be.. nice hotel.. will come back for sure😂,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Friendly, helpful staff at Reception and in the restaurant/bar. The room was spacious, pleasantly cool on arrival rather than overheated like most hotel rooms. Travelodge beds are very comfortable.  The rooms are simply furnished and restful on the eye. Internet works well – but costs £3 per 24 hours extra. I like the fact that at Travelodge hotels you can pick up more tea, coffee, milk & sugar in the lobby if you need it without having to ask. The hotel is not far from Gatwick Airport – there is a bus from stop No. 8 which will bring you to the Travelodge – current fare £4 (from both North & South Terminal).  Overall, a very pleasant stay if you're arriving very late at night or heading out very early.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda

"Pros: Clean, inexpensive and close to airport
No real cons
",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Upon arrival the staff were friendly and helpful, the room was beautiful and clean as was the bathroom (two towels!!). Food downstairs at the bar cafe was a wee bit expensive for what you actually got but again staff were great there and happy to help! Would definitely stay here again and recommend to family and friends. Reasonably priced and not far from airport. £4 shuttle bus, though signage for this would be greatly appreciated at the airport, hard to find.  ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Main meal was awful,lovely young staff member gave me a free desert",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
Close to the airport but you have to catch a taxi to and from but is only £6.00 each way. ,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"It’s okay that it was near the airport and it was very easy to get to Gatwick airport. There was shuttle bus, but a bit expensive. You have to borrow the hair dryer from the reception as they don’t have it in your own room. Check-in is quite strict that everyone has to check-in after 3pm, no earlier case except you pay....",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
Very small rooms. Clean enough. However air conditioning didn’t work. Room hot and stuffy,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
Nice one night stay. Clean and cozy room. ,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda

Would be nice if we could have more choices of meals in restaurants would enhance ,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"I was in London for a short trip so wasn't fussy of the amenities as I was going to be out the whole day anyway. Decent hotel for the price.
So travellers arriving at South terminal, to take the shuttle bus to the hotel, go outside and take the elevator down. Upon exiting the elevator head left to bus stop #9 and take the #G1 or G3 shuttle to the hotel. It will cost you 4 pounds. Good luck",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"It is OK, handy for the airport but all seems very basic.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
Close to the terminal. A short bus ride. Room was clean and comfortable. Ideal for an overnight to catch an early flight.,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Annoyed they would not allow 2 hour early bookin without a 10.00 fee  Your at an airport and people come at all hours of the day. I flew all night and was exhausted. I sent an email a week before when I booked saying I would arrive early and had no response back. At least then I would have known and could have stayed at the airport or somewhere else instead of sitting in the lobby for two hours as  I was not willing to pay the fee. I checked out at 4 Am the next day to catch my next flight. Maybe they should pay me for the remaining time I had in my reservation to check out time.  The front desk said she could not override her system to allow me to book in early.....not impressed!!! Room was clean, quite and would consider staying there again. Bar staff friendly, food ok. ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"I have been staying here every time I come to the UK and the staff has always been helpful and friendly. 
The room was clean except for the trash in the room was there after I had the room serviced in between my days there (not a big deal to me) I would stay here again and again ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"No frills, but a good price with a very nice breakfast included. 

Staff were very friendly and helpful.

Negatives: Shower head dripped all night, just a little maintenance required is all. Also food on an evening was very poor quality, super cheap ingredients and tasteless, at a premium price.

Still give it 5 stars overall and would return",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"The Travelodge served my purpose,  which was a one night stay between flights.
My main observation which really made no difference to the convenience of my stay, is that the reception area is very stark. It reminded me of a hostel foyer",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Great service, helpful staff always ready to give advice when it was needed great breakfasts and good coffee everyday, hotel shuttle always on time, rooms where spacious and clean.
Only issue was the frequency of the room make up I was there 7 days and only made up the room once not actually an issue but a bit troublesome.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Had a great 7 day stay at the Travel-lodge I had some business to attend to over that period it made a great base to work from, the staff where helpful and friendly.
From the bar staff right through to the front desk they always had an answer to any question that you posed to them.
The only issue was the cleaning rosta it was difficult to work out, as different staff where allocated to different rooms so I couldn't get my room cleaned on most occasions.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Very clean and welcoming! Despite location near to major road and airport surprisingly quiet and very comfortable beds. Didn’t pay a lot for the room so wasn’t expecting level of quality, certainly shows off its recent refit. All in all very good budget hotel that seems to aspire to higher levels!",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Hallway was dirty,  mirror light and shower extractor fan not connected to electric supply (staff said all rooms are like this!)  Our ground floor room had lots of traffic noise.

Great location to the Gatwick airpot",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
Clean and good for value stay if you plan to stay near Gatwick airport. There's a bus circling all the nearby airport hotels with 3£ one trip.,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"This hotel was better than I was expecting - spacious rooms, comfortable. The airport shuttle bus stopped outside (£3). Like most airport hotels the bar/restaurant was overpriced and the food was average. The reception staff weren’t that friendly and I would have appreciated a trolley for my bags.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Not good, look for a different hotel",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Clean, had kettle, comfortable and clean shower. Good meal selection from the cafe at reasonable price. 

But a far walk from bus station, and from the counter to our room ( we got the furthest room) 

We missed the shuttle so it's 350m walk from the nearest bus stop. Okay if you're solo with backpack but should reconsider if you have mobility restriction/knee issue/got luggage . If can catch the shuttle it's very convenient from the airport. 

We had to go to the front counter to activate the AC heater mode. no phone in the room so had to walk there. Max temp is capped at 25'C, and the AC seemed to off itself every few hours. As me and my mom were from tropical countries, obviously 25'C wasn't really sufficient. ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Great value for what you get, really comfy bed and the £4 shuttle to Gatwick Airport is really convenient. It runs every 15 mins and gets you to the airport in 20 mins! ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
Perfect location however it would be nice when booked to communicate how to get to the hotel using public transport and reminded to have cash on hand. Otherwise great staff in assisting me to get a taxi. ,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda

"There are bus from airport to the hotel frequently. It takes 10 minutes. 
The hotel is good and convenient at this price.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"The room was clean and comfortable, was a very good rest before an early flight out at Gatwick airport. However there was only 30 minutes of free WiFi (!!!) and the airport shuttle is an extra 4 pounds each way for a 10 minute trip. These costs should be included in the room, instead it was an unpleasant surprise to have multiple hidden costs.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Friendly , helpful staff and great service, hotel is in a great location and very clean. Only little issue we had was workman’s vans parking in the disabled bays, which meant dad had a longer walk back into the hotel ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
Staff good and Frendly ,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Place is ok except for the fact that the hotels airport bus only takes cash, I always try to get rid of my cash before I leave a country. Uber was crazy expensive. £20 each way for a 5 minute drive",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
I couldn't sleep. The people in the next room seemed to want to party until 2am. I couldn't sleep and had to wake at 4am.  It's really put me off using the hotel again. ,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"This is a clean hotel, not on the airport property. You can reach it by taking the G1 or G3 bus from Gatwick airport ( which runs 24 hours a day about every 20 minutes for the price of 4 pounds each way) or the number 100 bus that stops just on the road near the hotel. The room was clean. There are few options and the breakfast is not extensive but I believe it is good value especially compared to staying at the airport. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful. I would stay here again on a stopover. ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
Strategic location. Friendly and helpful staff. Breakfast is nice and with variety choices. Room is really spacious and clean for 2. ,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
Chose the hotel as I had an early morning flight. Internet was an add on - really in this day and age when most hotels and certainly big brands offer fast wifi included. The cost was £3 with Virgin and there was continually a signal issue. I mean I got no signal at all. Tried to call the number provided but that wasn’t working and tried again with the same message so watched Midsomer Murders on TV. I wrote to Virgin who refused refund as they said I should have alerted them to the problem. Told them I did but have heard nothing back not a sausage. Travelodge should pull that outsourcing immediately - it does their brand no favours. My room was so cold I could not sleep even though I fiddled with the a/c heater control.,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"I thought from the reviews that my co-worker and I could expect a clean room and wifi (who doesn't offer free wifi these days???) Room was not clean, bathroom not clean. Hallways dirty.. The twin room we booked was unavailable and so we had to share a bed.
Positive: Staff were friendly and foyer was comfortable.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Pros great location for Gatwick
Clean and modern hotel
Friendly staff
CONS - £16 per night to park., this needs to be HIGHLIGHTED that there is a parking charge to park at the hotel, even when you a guest.
I've stayed at numerous hotels near airports and the charge is waived if you are a guest at that hotel",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda

Would not recommend this hotel if you needed to use the parking.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
If 2 people in a room 2 towels would seem appropriate!,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Clean and spacious room and reasonable good breakfast provided.

Free Wifi for only miserable 30 mins! Had to pay around 8 pounds per 24 hours parking but cannot find a lot after midnight! Reception wanted to charge me 10 pounds to check in 1 hour early so preferred to wait even though room was available!",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"The receptionist was very rude for us and she was rushing and did not listen to our requests.
When I asked about water she told us to look around for water filters.
When I asked about shuttle Services she just gave me shuttle schedule to read it.
Those are fine, not offensive but very rude and mean.
They should show hospitality to everyone equally, not according to other appearances",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Very clean, very comfortable and food in the restaurant exceeded expectations, the only complaint was that after 25 minutes i had to hunt down my dessert. 
Would definitely stay there again, perfect for an early flight and just £3 on the regular shuttle.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda

Occupied. No soap in the shower. Won’t be back,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
Nice Hotel - Not sure I like the trend toward charging for all the extras like parking etc but I guess that is the way the budget hotels and companies seem to be going. Overall a very clean and well decorated hotel,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"The price of a family room was very good for the time of year. One double bed and 2 singles in the family room. Room size was big- could easily accommodate another couple of single beds. Basic room- no fridge,  iron/ironing board, no hairdryer even- basically nothing that was not stapled down. I assume you could get a hairdryer if you needed one. Cafe/bar was large and food was tasty enough for dinner with meal deals making it quite affordable. Breakfast was standard and covered hot and cold buffet food for 9pounds per adult with 2 children (15 and under) per adult, free, which made it good value for breakfast. Convenient airport shuttle from Bay 8 at North terminal. ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Ideal for airport stopover. Used shuttle bus to airport which was fine, took about 20min. Not sure how it is when busy. I was 5.15 am. ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda

Answer: ""it takes as long as it takes"" not a very forthcoming statement!!",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda

Despite this I would say good value for money.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Free wifi only for 30 minutes what was not mentioned during reservation
  
",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"The problem I had was the inability to make contact with the outside world The hotel has no telephones - none in the rooms, no public phone !!!  I had to borrow a cellphone from the receptionist to make a (local only) call. Fortunately I have a contact in the UK. But for a hotel at a major airport, this failure  is amazing !! Like all ex-pat travellers I need to contact home  - I was not in England for pleasure and regular communications are vital. 

We are all supposed to use the Internet these days and I did bring my tablet computer but unfortunately the hotel's wi-fi was too feeble to get a connection. 

This is not the first of similar complaints I have had about other UK hotels. British hoteliers would do well to understand that not everyone in the world lives in the UK. A hotel near to an international airport should have worked out by now that we ex-pats and foreigners use airport hotels but we need to call telephones in overseas countries.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
Shuttle services right on spot; super friendly staff and great food!! Really enjoyed my stay!!,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda

On both occasions we’ve stayed, the water was only slightly above lukewarm. Other than the room & water temperatures, it was a comfortable stay and good value.

This place was quite ok. I didn’t realise when I booked it that I would have to get the bus there from the N terminal. Once you find the bus stop it is ok. Good breakfast.,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Came in to eat breakfast ( paid for it ), but was met with big suspicions - they thought I am from the street or maybe homeless and came to steal their English breakfast?

Beautifully clean and very friendly staff. ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Staff helpful, accommodating. Nice that hotel staff encouraged cafe staff to talk to visitors I was told.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Really great for an airport hotel. The room was clean, the mattress was very comfortable. The shower had great pressure, water could have been a bit hotter. The only drawback was that it’s low on amenities. There was no hair dryer, no phone in the room so no wake up call (in case the iPhone messed up the alarm). Wish it had it been a pod coffee maker instead of an older plastic kettle. But really, for the price it was very decent. Hotel shuttle was convenient although the shuttle signage at the airport is confusing with regards to this particular hotel. The shuttle also costs £3.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"In a good location but would need a taxi or take the shuttle bus  (free). Room was clean, beds awesome!  I would stay here again!",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
The location was perfect as it was .4 miles from the terminal. There is a shuttle that runs from the terminal to the hotel but costs 3 pounds each way.  The room was comfortable and bathroom was clean.  The staff was friendly and I will recommend and stay here again.,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
rooms was clean - stayed one night .Breakfast was terrible ,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"It’s not far from airport, but can’t walk. You need to take hotel bus at stop 9. Shuttle bus will service every 15 mins. It cost you 3 pound per trip. Will drop you or pick up you at hotel front door.

"This hotel was dreadful! When we opened the door to enter our room we thought we had been given the wrong room and they were obviously planning to renovate it. The room had a bed and a chair ....... That's all. There was a tv on the wall but it was impossible to change channels as the remote didn't work. There was no soap, shampoo or any toiletries at all. The towels were so thin they were soaked before you were dry, the shower was difficult to turn on. There was no phone, no hairdryer and no stand to put the case on. After addressing these to the reception staff  who were very unhelpful I asked if I could have a stand to put my case on I was very rudely told, what's wrong with the floor, use that !! Alfie the person I spoke to at re epsilon was particularly rude and unhelpful as were the bar staff. I will never ever stay at another Travelodge after this experience",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
Comfortable and convenient.,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"The staff were nice and friendly. Very basic room. Only had a bed and a small desk, no other furniture. Not warm and welcoming. The bed was very comfortable though. We went to the restaurant for dinner and were told the food would be an hour wait, so we went next door to another hotel and had a delicious fish &  chips dinner in their lounge.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"This hotel is furnished in the style of a hostel rather than a pleasurable place to relax and unwind. Facilities were fine, the room and the hotel in general were clean, it's close to the airport and, like several hotels in the area is served by several shuttle buses to and from the north and south terminals at Gatwick. The room I had was quite large and the bathroom had a deep bath. The bed was fine although the polyester in the sheets was noticeable. However the dinner I had was the most awful I've had in years. I ordered the steak and ale pie, peas and mash. The pie was contained one small piece of meat and two slices of mushroom and was encased in quarter inch thick pastry which was completely sodden by the internal gravy as well as the additional gravy on top. The mashed potatoes were dry and hard on the edges and bottom, as if left over from lunch and reheated on the plate, and there were less than a quarter of a cup of peas. The sticky toffee pudding was enjoyable.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda

Great place to stay. Staff very friendly. However in order to get there from the airport you must use shuttle  (3£ cash) or cab (6£) even if it’s in a walking distance and you could see it from the airport. There is simply no direct walk path.  Don’t use Uber because they over charge at Gatwic (17£),Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda

"Good nights stay for an early morning flight. Room clean and tide, good shower, breakfast was great.

All round top-hole.

The only niggle, and nothing to do with the hotel is the bus transfer to the terminals. £4 per person, so, 2 people £8, or if you go by taxi £6 for two.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"The staff were very nice, helpful however, for the price, some help with luggage for an older person would be welcome. Also only 30mins free wifi and then have to pay online rather than option to pay cash at recption. Ist, for the price and as all international hotels, Wifi could be expected to be free, even 1 hour for contact with eg relatives and there was no way I would use my card online, so I didn't bother. Staff were very kind and let me use their phone at no charge to let my 97yo friend I was to visit that I had arrived in the country and the time I would see her next day, as O had no UK phone card yet.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda

"I was in London for a short trip so wasn't fussy of the amenities as I was going to be out the whole day anyway. Decent hotel for the price.
So travellers arriving at South terminal, to take the shuttle bus to the hotel, go outside and take the elevator down. Upon exiting the elevator head left to bus stop #9 and take the #G1 or G3 shuttle to the hotel. It will cost you 4 pounds. Good luck",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda

"I booked this hotel for an overnight staying due to the early flight departure. I arrived in the night at 22 PM, the hotel is 5 minutes with a bus (3 £ fee each way) from the Gatwick North Terminal.
Check in process was pretty straight forward. My room, however, was not properly insulated and I could hear the conversation of other guests outside. Furthermore, and more annoying,  there was a constant noise like some water leak from the floor above, which disturbed me all night long, not allowing to have a good sleep. Furthermore, and the reason of my main disappointment, was the breakfast. I have booked this hotel because I wanted to have a proper hot English breakfast before leaving, paying an additional booking fee (around 8.5 £) to get it included in the room rate, while in the morning it turned out that for some unknown kitchen problem,  it was not available, so I was forced to skip it and I was not even be asked if I would like to be refund for it since it was not provided.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda

"Everything else was very good but it was a bit disappointing that the Wifi only allowed 30 minutes free access. After that it was £3 for 24 hours.

Also had to pay for parking but I suppose that’s pretty standard.

The staff were friendly and helpful and there was a kettle in the room for tea and coffee which I always appreciate.  ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"I arrived very late to the hotel and also had a very early morning flight. The check-in process was so simple and easy. The receptionist was kind and professional. I received my room key card very fast. So I was able to go to my room and go to bed right away.

My room was comfortable and the bed was so clean and firm. The pillows were so clean and fresh. 

The soap dispenser in the bathroom was broken. That was the only issue. 

So for the price and location these are great reasons to stay in the hotel. ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda

"The hotel is just two bus stops away from Gatwick North terminal but there isn't much else around the area. The room was very clean and spacious but I didn't know check-in time was 3pm so I had to wait at the bar for 3 hours. Also, wifi is only free for 30mins every 24 hours. I paid for 24hours of wifi then it stopped working after just 2 hours and for the rest of my stay, which was very annoying because I couldn't get work done. Their staff just said there was nothing they could do but wait, so I guess they don't have any in house tech support. They also didn't offer to give me a refund on the wifi. It's a nice place if you don't need wifi for work, or just staying for a short period of time like I did.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda

The rooms are simply furnished and restful on the eye. Internet works well – but costs £3 per 24 hours extra. I like the fact that at Travelodge hotels you can pick up more tea, coffee, milk & sugar in the lobby if you need it without having to ask. The hotel is not far from Gatwick Airport – there is a bus from stop No. 8 which will bring you to the Travelodge – current fare £4 (from both North & South Terminal).

I sent an email a week before when I booked saying I would arrive early and had no response back. At least then I would have known and could have stayed at the airport or somewhere else instead of sitting in the lobby for two hours as  I was not willing to pay the fee. I checked out at 4 Am the next day to catch my next flight. Maybe they should pay me for the remaining time I had in my reservation to check out time.

Still give it 5 stars overall and would return",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda

For that price i expect the basics necessity to be working fine. The heater panel doesnt work and it on and off by itself throughout. The staff says that they can control it from their side i don't know how but the heater just turn on and off by itself. ,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
Near to Gatwick Airport and the bus shuttle (£3/ way)run very frequent and on time btw airport n hotel. Bus stop right in front of the hotel lobby ,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda

"Room was spartan but the bed comfortable and clean. The a/c was making a horrible noise when running . Reception said they’d send someone, but no one came. Food at the bar was excellent . No coat hangars or dresser to put items in or on. Other than that it was good. ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda

"This hotel was better than I was expecting - spacious rooms, comfortable. The airport shuttle bus stopped outside (£3). Like most airport hotels the bar/restaurant was overpriced and the food was average. The reception staff weren’t that friendly and I would have appreciated a trolley for my bags.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Not good, look for a different hotel",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Clean, had kettle, comfortable and clean shower. Good meal selection from the cafe at reasonable price. 

But a far walk from bus station, and from the counter to our room ( we got the furthest room) 

We missed the shuttle so it's 350m walk from the nearest bus stop. Okay if you're solo with backpack but should reconsider if you have mobility restriction/knee issue/got luggage . If can catch the shuttle it's very convenient from the airport. 

We had to go to the front counter to activate the AC heater mode. no phone in the room so had to walk there. Max temp is capped at 25'C, and the AC seemed to off itself every few hours. As me and my mom were from tropical countries, obviously 25'C wasn't really sufficient. ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
I couldn't sleep. The people in the next room seemed to want to party until 2am. I couldn't sleep and had to wake at 4am.  It's really put me off using the hotel again. ,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"This is a clean hotel, not on the airport property. You can reach it by taking the G1 or G3 bus from Gatwick airport ( which runs 24 hours a day about every 20 minutes for the price of 4 pounds each way) or the number 100 bus that stops just on the road near the hotel. The room was clean. There are few options and the breakfast is not extensive but I believe it is good value especially compared to staying at the airport. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful. I would stay here again on a stopover. ",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
Strategic location. Friendly and helpful staff. Breakfast is nice and with variety choices. Room is really spacious and clean for 2. ,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
Chose the hotel as I had an early morning flight. Internet was an add on - really in this day and age when most hotels and certainly big brands offer fast wifi included. The cost was £3 with Virgin and there was continually a signal issue. I mean I got no signal at all. Tried to call the number provided but that wasn’t working and tried again with the same message so watched Midsomer Murders on TV. I wrote to Virgin who refused refund as they said I should have alerted them to the problem. Told them I did but have heard nothing back not a sausage. Travelodge should pull that outsourcing immediately - it does their brand no favours. My room was so cold I could not sleep even though I fiddled with the a/c heater control.,Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"I thought from the reviews that my co-worker and I could expect a clean room and wifi (who doesn't offer free wifi these days???) Room was not clean, bathroom not clean. Hallways dirty.. The twin room we booked was unavailable and so we had to share a bed.
Positive: Staff were friendly and foyer was comfortable.",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda
"Pros great location for Gatwick
Clean and modern hotel

CONS - £16 per night to park., this needs to be HIGHLIGHTED that there is a parking charge to park at the hotel, even when you a guest.
I've stayed at numerous hotels near airports and the charge is waived if you are a guest at that hotel",Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central,agoda

Stopped here before a early morning outbound flight & on my return from my holiday.   I stopped in a super room which in my opinion is well worth the extra money i didn't really use the coffee machine although the kit kats in room is a nice finishing touch. I also like the you can dim the main lights right down which is nice when you want to start getting settled before bed.   The room i had 653 is one of the biggest in the hotel and it was lovely to have such space and also have a view and watch the planes come into land. On my outbound flight i had booked for the room to be made up has a double however it wasn't but this wasnt a problem for the staff on duty and the nice pleasant lady with glasses i believe she was a supervisor or manager came up stairs and clipped the beds,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
…,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"We stayed here the night before our flight out of Gatwick, at £39 for the super room plus £16 parking for the night I have very little complaint.   It’s close to the airport so there was quite a bit of noise of planes coming in and taking off and the odd siren but frankly that’s to be expected being so close to the airport and didn’t ruin the stay at all.   The room was clean and tidy and came with a coffee machine. The hotel also has a bar that serves food saving us the issue of trying to find somewhere inexpensive to eat.   Would happily book here again in future.   Only downsides - £16 for parking wasn’t made clear on the website when we booked and you can’t check in until 3pm, most other Travelodge a I’ve been to are 2pm. Neither would stop me booking again though ","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"Myself and my partner we’re going to NYC and we live in Derby so needed a hotel - booked this as it was incredibly cheap and convenient, all in all the stay was absolutely fine. The only downside it that you have to pay for 24 hours of parking which I believe is £16... we had an early flight so we were there for around 5 hours, £16 was ridiculous baring in mind I think we paid around £35 for the room.

"Paid for entry into room as travelled from Cornwall and advised poor weather - room not ready on arrival, no explanation and certainly no apology. Room hot - terrible. Outside window was a vent from an extractor fan - awful. Will never go back; probably never use a travel lodge again.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"We have now used the Travelodge twice for an overnight stay at Gatwick and have had a great stay both times. The rooms are large and comfortable and good value for money. However, the parking cost is now extortianate! It used to be £8 and now its £16! Not worth it in my opinion and if this doesn't change, I would think about staying somewhere else instead.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

This hotel was fantastic value for money and has had a multi million pound makeover. The staff were very polite and the rooms very clean and comfortable. The food wasn’t so good especially the “big burger” it was more like tinned burgers stuck together but the pizzas were amazing.

Don't park at this hotel because the price of parking is ridiculous.  £128 for 8 days. It used to be half that. The staff seem to be sympathetic but can't do anything about it. Travelodge need to get a grip before people stop staying. ,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"If you think you have a good deal add £16 per night for staying guests parking charges. Hotel is clean and basic, food is quick food only; pizzas and the like. The parking charge is really a rip off because one is not aware of it until arrival at which time it is too late to make alternative  arrangements. I have NEVER been charged for parking while staying at a hotel before. It might be in the small print somewhere but just be forewarned.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"We -myself,my partner & my son -stayed here overnight before flying to Barcelona. This hotel was cheap & reviewed well. How it has reviewed well is beyond me. I'll start with the room itself.... there was no soap in either dispensor in the room, had that of been all then I wouldn't be mentioning it. 2 of the 4 pillows had stains, as did both sets of bed sheets. The aircon unit ran like a backed up overflow all night with no way to turn it off. So no sleep for us. The one thing that did work was the wi-fi.  On top of that we ordered food in the resturant that night, not so much a choice as a lack of options but nevermind. I wouldn't expected the food to be great or cheap. And it wasn't. It was servicable. My chicken burger wss fine but the serving of chips with it was laughably","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"£16 to park the car for 24 hours isn’t bad, but considering we wasn’t staying for 24 hours its a rip off. No option to pay for a certain amount of hours, just 24.  Paid for a superior room but it didn’t look any different to a standard room. Stains all over the carpets, stains on the bedsheets and dirty towels. The one towel looked as if someone had been in and wiped a face full of foundation off.  Not very clear in the photos but its there and its disgusting. £75 I paid for the room, when I could have paid £40 and got exactly the same in a standard room.  This was just a stop over close to Gatwick Airport ready for our flight to Florida for our honeymoon. ","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"I have stayed T this hotel every week for the last 4 months & have to say All the staff are really nice,friendly & very helpful just a couple of points which let it down. All the other travelodges I’ve stay in all do the same they want to charge you to use the WiFi which if you check the bandwidth of it it’s not worth paying for as the speed is far to slow to use for anything useful WiFi should come free like the majority of hotels are nowadays you can even go in a supermarket & get free WiFi so there is no excuse  also the Gatwick one is charging customers £16.00 a day to park on top of the price of rooms which works out rather expensive I know it’s close to the airport & the land is owned by the airport but really !!

Normally stay at Premier Inn Gatwick North but personally this is half the price and a 2 minute cab journey to the terminal and it's only 6 pounds where the shuttle is 4 and even with the transportation cost it's still a great price to stay here. Top marks. Well done Travelodge,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

Having used this hotel many times prior to flying out from Gatwick I have found it extremely convenient and there have been noticeable improvements over the past few years. The rooms are spacious and clean. The beds comfortable. The restaurant is serviceable with plenty of choice and special meal deals on offer. The staff have always been courteous and helpful. The big problem is the cost of the car park. I know that this is not necessarily under Travelodge control but there is no other choice but to use it for the overnight stay and at a cost of £16 for a 24 hour period I do believe this is a very high price for this facility - and it is listed as a facility by Travelodge ,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

The parking costs about as much as a room. Its $17 for a terrible terrible hamburger that makes you long for Burger King. Coleslaw was terrible quality. $5 for the Wifi. $14 for the bus each way even though it takes for a like 4 minute ride - you can't walk this, because they don't allow for pedestrians in the UK.

Upon arrival at the hotel, check-in is with a machine that gives you room keys in less than 2 minutes. The rooms are ideal for the price you pay, comfortable, functional and clean. The rest is very good and the rooms are in good condition.  The hotel is designed to make everything fast and efficient for travelers. From when you arrive until you leave, everything is automated, indicated shuttle times, ATM and food service all the time.

Over very welcoming no matter when you arriving . I stopped here prior to my holiday and also when I returned . 24/7 bar and food which is great for a one on a delay ( like myself). Both rooms I stayed in was ok but could do with an upgrade to the heating as either it worked intermittent or was too load and not about to sleep. Breakfast as always is great there and comfort is good.  Does not affect me but I really feel that WIFI should be included free for longer than 30 mins a day. A lot of competitors have this already.

We all were impressed with our meals including our vegetarian daughter.  They do a 2 course meal for £14 per head but we were beaten after just one course.  WiFi is free for 30 mins and then charged at £3 for 24 hours.  We paid for parking whilst we stayed but chose to use Gatwick valet parking which proved to be more cost effective than leaving our car for a week.,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"1st room was unclean stains on the carpet greasy hand prints on the walls, brown stains on the bedding, kettle deff not worth using.....grose, bathroom was grim hair not from your head on the floor and skirtings!. Got moved straight away no problem to a room that was no better so me and my children cleaned it ourselves as we were told it's not a big enough issue to keep moving us or to have a refund, we made the best of a bad situation as it was only a 2 night stay, would deff pack bleach on your stay here .","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

Had mislaid my case keys and Chloe went out of her way to ask if another colleague could sort it for me and they did, Well done Chloe this is what i call customer service i didnt even have to ask .Shuttle bus is super and for only 3pounds a bargain.

Convenient and well connected to Gatwick airport. Rooms are fully functional hotel atmosphere is welcoming. Cleaneness could be improved both in the rooms and the corridors. The carpet is quite tired.,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
Very expensive parking and bathroom not very clean. Parking was charged per 24 hours and hourly parking could not be purchased making a 10 hour stay very expensive. This was not made clear on booking.,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
Travelodge by Gatwick is pretty much exactly what you can expect from the airport hotel.  Our room was very simple but clean and downstairs there was actually quite a nice bar open 24 hours. Nice touch for those who arrive late.  They are clearly trying to be modern woth the self check in machines by reception but unfortunately they still require some improvements.  After checking in my machine was unable to produce my room key so at the end I had to queue to go through the same process at reception anyway.   Also bear in mind that parking is quite dear with £16 per night. ,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Travelodge is a perfect hotel if you need to go to Gatwick airport. The hotel is in walking distance of the airport (north terminal) but there is no dedicated path, you can walk along the big road (15 minutes) or take the ""perimeter road"" (30 minutes but safer) both with a part without pathway. The hotel is great value for money, it is even the cheapest 3 stars I ever had. However, it offers really spacious, confortable and modern rooms. It is not heaten too much (there is nothing worse). The rooms and the hotel are clean, but it could be even better. It is calm and the beds are good quality. There is also a very good restaurant with affordable deals. For those who have a car, the parking is really expansive (£16 a day), don't park here.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Stayed 1 night before travel. Caught the shuttle both ways from Gatwick for a small charge. Automated check in if you would like to, very simple. Reception staff were very friendly and helpful. Room good size and clean. Very comfortable bed. All you need for a night before you travel. You do have to pay for WiFi except for a short initial free period but not a problem for an odd night I suppose. Huge tesco superstore within a 15 minute walk if you forget anything. Would stay again","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
Hotel had a lot of work upgrading it which is all great and staff were great too. One to watch is happy hour isn’t but one get one free it is a little bit of the drinks.

"My friend and I stayed at Travelodge Central before a 7am flight to Nice.  Coming off the Gatwick Express, it was difficult to navigate to find the bus (stop 9), but we found it in the end. One thing to remember is that the cost of the bus costs £4 each way.  The bus ride was quick and Travelodge was either the first or second hotel which was good.  The check-in process was easy and the hotel staff were happy to give information on when to get the bus in the morning.  The room was incredibly spacious with a large double bed and a pull out bed - which actually was comfortable! The room was really clean and looked like it had been modernised recently.   There was a kettle in the room which meant even though we woke up at 4am, I could still have a cuppa!  There is a restaurant, but","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"Very convenient for Gatwick airport, nice receptionist, arrived in the early hours and room felt cold.  Main grumble was noise from internal plumbing, don't know exactly what it was, gurgling, also low rumble of traffic from road.  Bed and bedding very comfy, shower was dirty, soap scum and long black hairs on the walls.  Take note of the directions from airport to Travelodge before you go if you're staying on your return like us - it cost us over £26 and a half hour wait for an Uber taxi, for a distance of around 1 mile. Gatwick signage is appalling and confusing.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"The hotel is adequate in all respects except for the parking charges. They have increased 100% since my last stay, around 12 months ago. They are £16 for 24 hours. As patrons rarely stay during the day, it proves to be very expensive. When I questioned these charges, I was told that an 'outside company' control the car park. It seemed strange to me that although I could get a supposed a Travelodge Customer Discount - DOWN to £ 16 - there was nothing in my ticket input to show who I was & what & where in fact I was staying. I was told that the 'Outside Company ' have access to the hotel's bookings & could identify the person's car that was parked. Utter nonsense..

"I had a one night stop prior to flying out of Gatwick and this travelodge is my usual weapon of choice for the night before. Super rooms are pretty good. Everything worked as it should, it was clean and plenty of space. They provide a coffee machine. I had breakfast as well, which is a self service buffet arrangement and that was pretty good, although some black pudding would have been a nice addition. The bar is nice enough, though a tad pricey. Not as pricey as the car parking though. Be warned. Overnight parking for hotel guests has gone up recently from £8 to £16 per vehicle which I think is taking the proverbial.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

As a regular stayer at the travelodge central gatwick the staff and service never fails to amaze me. Through the refurbs and issues the staff are always there to support us and help us. They always do. I am concerned about the welfare of the staff and sometimes what they have to deal with. They always deal with everything in an amazing way however im worried their safety and well being and even though they deal with everything in a good way for what they get paid and what they have to deal with they must be put under alot of stress. They should be security management for the night staff at least. Staying here for two nights i realised that the staff have to put up with alot of drunk customers.

I doubt my friends completely believed me when I relayed this story to them.   Let’s start with the good: the shuttle service to and from the hotel is reliable and prompt, if slightly pricy for a family. The room was clean and modern, SOME staff helpful, kind and friendly and the breakfast was delicious.  We decided to eat at the restaurant/cafe on site as it was convenient. The menu only provided burgers and pizzas, with a few specials, aka anything that is not food for a child’s birthday party, listed on a small blackboard in the corner.

"We checked in on the 29th of March and checked out April 5th and our sheets where not changed even after reporting the concerns to the front desk repeatedly. When we checked in, the sheet on one of the bed had some red stains on it so I wonder if it was changed since the last guests checked out. Housekeeping showed up 3 times to make our beds and the first time they did a pretty good job. The second time they made our beds they left half of my sheet hanging on the floor and the last time they simply folded it. The floors where never swept and the bathroom never cleaned.

I was informed that each room’s air con unit is linked to 9 others so they were unable to over ride mine to cool as it would affect 9 other rooms too. RIDICULOUS!

We had a drink in the newly made over bar, which I have to say is a big improvement. That time we stayed before we had food, the food was terrible.

Stayed here for one night prior to a long haul flight and booked a accessible room. What a trek the room was the furthest room from the lift and a real trek for my disabled sister. If you are in a wheelchair it would be ok as the room was huge being at the end of a long corridor. Only one chair in the room and a bed.very cold. Bar and staff were good but the room was in need of a good vacuuming.

"I have often stayed at this hotel and have always found it to be clean, and to give good customer service. The reception staff were lovely as usual, but the room (no 444) had a terrible damp smell in the bathroom that permeated throughout the room. When I showered a creepy message appeared in the mirror (which was probably from a previous resident) and there was no hand soap in the dispenser. It just felt like the room had not been paid the usual level of care and attention.   My other criticism is that the tea/coffee and hot chocolate machine had been removed from downstairs- in all honesty this is the primary reason we so frequently stay at the Travelodge. It’s presence is a saving grace for an early morning flight.   I will use the hotel again, as this is the first time I","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"Booked this hotel as we wanted somewhere convenient and close to the airport as we were arriving late in the evening. It's a good idea that they have a snack bar that is open to get food after the restaurant has closed. We had 3 rooms and were given the keys to each but with no explanation as to where our rooms were, breakfast times we had to ask for, the receptionist really didn't acknowledge us. We ended up walking up and down corridors to find our rooms. The keys of the 3 rooms were all mixed up. First impressions of the room was it was large, had everything in it you wanted as far as kettle, tea, coffee etc. The bed was quite comfy but the air conditioning just seemed to blow out cold regardless of how high you turned it up. The duvet was 10.5 tog. I felt cold all night.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

The reception staff were welcoming and friendly, there were free hot drinks available from machines in reception 24/7, as well as tea making facilities in the room. Breakfast was available from 7am and included a buffet style selection of cooked breakfast items, as well as cereals, toast, juices, etc. I haven't stayed at a Travelodge for years because, well, its a Travelodge!

There’s a reason why I never go to a travel inn as there crap. We stayed as part of our parking deal flying from Gatwick to Vegas. It’s getting refurbished so there’s an awful smell. We were ground floor and it stunk of chip fat. The room was clean. I had to walk back to reception for a hairdryer. I’m sorry but that’s a total basic in any room world wide. When you arrive your ripped off with a parking charge. They don’t tell you when booking. You have to ring a premium number and pay with your card. £8-12 can’t remember exactly. Come getting up the bathroom flooded as the shower curtain was 5 inches higher than the shower tray. Total crap hotels. Personally I can’t stand them. I didn’t book it and never would.

What a total disappointment the Fruit Sundae and Fruit Salad were - the fruit is bland and tasteless - when I told the waiter all he asked was did we want something else - we declined - as is practice here we had already paid at time of ordering.

The prices are very reasonable, parking costs to be expected and shuttle to Gatwick is an additional cost, but the hotel has so much going for it.

Our (family) room was large, clean and comfortable. Unusually, for a Travelodge, it even had two chairs.   The hotel benefited from having its own bar and large restaurant on the premises.

Travelodge does a super saver rate of around £30 per room and to this you can order the meal deal of evening meal and breakfast , we use to order both but don't anymore . the reason for this is the limited choice for the dinner is small , the breakfast buffet is very nice and have whatever you want of full English with toast coffee juice fruit yogurts etc for around £15 for two  .

The 30minute-free Wi-Fi option is not available for days on end and occasionally even for the paid-for 24-hour option you get 30 minutes. When I complained at reception, they suggested that I call the internet provider myself. This used to be well regulated and we have not come across it elsewhere, only at Travelodge Gatwick. I don't know if other guests have had a similar experience, but to rob paying guests of an already stingy internet service in this day and age is unacceptable.

Great hotel for a good nights sleep before your flight. Beds are comfy. Rooms are spacious and the staff very friendly. Taxi from hotel to airport only £6 or shuttle bus £3 per person. Taxi from Gatwick to the hotel is £11. Bit of a rip off but apparently one company has the concession so maybe find the shuttle bus instead. We had dinner in the hotel as it was convenient and it was fine. Drinks a bit pricey though. Didn’t have breakfast as there is loads of choice in the airport. Overall I would definitely recommend.

Clean room allocated (No22) not too far from reception which we were pleased with. Only minor gripe was, what sounded like the constant running of water coming from the air conditioning unit area, which went on throughout the night.

Stayed here as had an early flight in the morning. Was fairly cheap which was a massive bonus and rooms were adequately sized and had a tv. Close to a petrol station if you needed something urgently.   The only downside was that the aircon/heater even when off was very loud and one of the vending machines in the reception didn’t seem to work for me (although I may have been doing it wrong)  We also were woken up by some inconsiderate people who were shouting and laughing outside our room although that’s not something the hotel can manage.

Breakfast was very poor, not a lot of variety... just English breakfast and that’s it!  Dinner... food felt like microwave food!  I have stayed at other travelodge and it was so much better!

"This place looks pretty smart after its refurb, but we had nothing but problems from the minute we arrived. Checked in late in the evening ahead of a flight the following morning, but found a bed with no pillows and a dismantled shower in our room.  No phone to ring down to reception, so had to walk back down to ask for a room change. Lady on reception was very apologetic, and gave us a different room. Unfortunately, this one also had a shower that was in pieces, so after a trudge back to reception, we were moved to a third room.   This one seemed much better, but we soon found out that the air conditioning was stuck on heat, and there was no way of switching it off. By this stage it was about 1am, and we had an early flight, so had to make the best of it.   After such a poor","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"I was pleasantly surprised by my stay at this Travelodge close to Gatwick North Terminal. A very pleasant and efficient welcome at reception, followed by a spacious and (by Travelodge standards) luxurious room on the sixth floor, with great views of the airport. Their new super rooms are extremely good value for money in my opinion. It's not really somewhere you'd stay for an extended period, but for a stopover before an early flight it is probably the best option.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

This Travelodge was great in terms of booking, and facilities and allowed us to have a good nights sleep before our early(ish) flight.  I was able to book a specific disabled room on-line. Booking on-line meant I was able to access a discount (always a bonus!) We've found we have to call many hotels directly to arrange this so this was a definite tick.  The level access was great. The room was great, had enough room to manouver the wheelchair and had really good lighting. The bed was comfy and we had a good nights sleep.

"My former review was deleted because of a ""major renovation"" that is absurd as my review was about location and how dirty the room was. Nothing to do with what kind of furniture, etc.  We had A LOT of hairs from other people all over the room. We should not have accepted that, but as we had only 5 hours as our plane departed very early in the morning we did not sleep between the sheets, but used a towel on top of the sheets. A few lamps where not working (so not changed in time). Will not recommend the hotel as of these reassons.  Otherwise good location from Gatwick Airport, close to Tesco supermarket, but there are other hotels around which are probably better, which should not be too difficult.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"Many aspects of my stay were fine; mostly friendly and helpful staff, mostly clean and fresh, and food on site was ok and reasonably priced also.  There were a few setbacks though that I was almost going to ignore however, what tipped me into writing a review was that the only accessable cash machine charged almost £2 to withdraw cash (should probably make that a bit more clear on the website).   When I got in the shower I noticed there was a hair on the wall next to a concerning red drip stain! Down the edge of the soap dispenser was a seal of black mould, something you don't really want to see when you're showering...

Next was at how quickly I was greeted any “Claire” on the reception. She has the perfect customer service service that is lacking in many hotels.

Not much room for clothes storage so you will be living out of your suitcase on a king stay but as most visitors are overnight for the airport it is probably not an issue. The bathroom is clean and bright ( there is a tendency I have found recently for hotel bathrooms to be lit up with bright daylight settings.

"Ok, so I don't live in a bubble. I know not to expect much from a budget airport hotel, but I've stayed in others before where the experience has been excellent, just by getting a few simple details right. This hotel missed the mark. Checking in was far from hassle-free. They couldn't charge us for parking for some reason, so we had to call the number ourselves. There were two different ""location codes"", and no-one told me which one to use to get their £8 rate so I had to make the same call three times.   The restaurant served an anaemic and dry katsu curry, which I only finished out of hunger. But the special mention goes to the aggressive waiter who got disproportionately upset over a matter of swapped table numbers. We only swapped to accommodate a larger family, but we'd","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"I stayed for one night here as my flight from Gatwick back to Calgary left early the next morning, and I was impressed. My previous Travelodge experience had been about 15 years ago and was underwhelming – cheap melamine furniture, unattractive and sparse room and unfriendly staff – but this was worlds apart. Friendly and courteous reception staff took the time to explain the hotel-airport bus schedule, and the room was spacious and, for the cost, well equipped. The bathroom especially was contemporary and very clean, the bed was really comfortable and the coffee/tea facilities were great (the Kit-Kats were a nice touch!). I'd been a little nervous about potential aircraft noise being so close to Gatwick, but I only heard one aircraft at about 7am which wasn't a problem.

"If you have an early flight from Gatwick, I can recommend this hotel. A shuttlebus comes frequently in the early hours, right outside the front doors, costs £3 and takes you to both the North and South terminals. You can catch the bus back to the hotel from the airport as well. Room was large, clean and nicely decorated. Food in the downstairs cafe was good, if limited in choice.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"I was using the hotel to help with an early morning flight. Although I was given a new room, the problems were with the restaurant.  There was no one available to seat me when I arrived. After 10 minutes I joined the long, slow moving queue for food instead. I was told there would be a 30 minute wait for food and that I could get a taxi into the nearest town or try a hotel nearby as an alternative, which whilst helpful, defeated the point of my stay. The food took 75 minutes to arrive and was very average. The delay meant I had a late night and therefore had less sleep than planned -  the purpose of my stay. Not good value for money this time around.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

You get what you pay for, a nice clean room and comfortable stay with no frills. I would recommend staying here, especially if using the airport.

The restaurant was extremely busy but staff were unfailingly polite and cheerful despite the number of weary travellers. Katie at the reception area was particularly helpful despite the number of customers clamouring for attention and sometimes fractious due to the situation. Yes we waited 3 hours for check in but the manner in which staff reacted was the best I have experienced when faced with a crisis.

It's parking near the airport. Are you really that surprised? And it's nobody's fault for the people who don't do their research. There were plenty parking spaces as well. We had dinner in the restaurant. Prices were reasonable and food was actually good despite what all the moaning reviewers said. We had pizza and beers and delicious dessert. Service was fast too. Public toilets in the lobby were kind of gross, but I couldn't wait till we went up to our room to have a wee, next time I will. As every travelodge, rooms are basic but clean and beds comfy.

We stayed here en route to Gatwick airport. As always the room was as described and the reception staff were excellent. The issue was the car parking machine which was out of order and has been for some time. This meant you had to phone through your details on a premium rate number and incur various charges for confirmation etc. The main issue was the fact that you could not enter the discount code for your stay so we’re charged full price. I actually cancelled the transaction and complained. The reception staff were really helpful and gave me a free parking voucher they also advised that this was a real issue and the company would not fix the machines.

It was on the first floor so I took the lift only to discover that there was no lift access to my room and the only access was up a flight of stairs. I had a 23kg case with me so this was not ideal.

"Great Travelodge with brilliantly helpful staff. Clean comfortable quiet & quick to get to terminal 2. Much better than the dreadful stay I recently had at Travelodge Covent Garden- which I would not recommend at all. There I was kept awake by a cold draft from the window, badly fitted curtains which let the light in; I couldn't use my heater as it was right over my bed & very noises - so I was also cold all night.

Good room and value for money was high - hotel recently undergone significant refurbishment and our room and all reception/bar area was clean and modern.   The restaurent service was prompt - slightly limited menu for choice but OK.  Food was OK ,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"We had an early flight so decided to stay the night before so that we could drive up the day before the flight and at least sleep until about 3am. Staff were polite, helpful and friendly. There was a cafe/restaurant downstairs, which was fairly basic but we had a decent meal. We moved to the seating area near the bar after we had eaten to have a drink there. The bed was comfortable and we slept well. Shuttle bus service was very efficient. Would stay again.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
Given it’s excellent proximity to the airport with shuttle buses every 15 mins this is the perfect solution without investing lots of money.  The rooms are very comfortable the bar is open 24/7 and the large reception and staff are more common in a higher rated venue.  I actually couldn’t fault it ,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
Great location near Gatwick Airport with 24/7 shuttle bus transport at reasonable cost. Very clean with extra comfortable beds. My only mild complaint was that hsving a ground floor room waz rather like living in a fishbowl so some kind of net curtaining would be appreciated.,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

never been so disgusted with a company .will never use travellodge again .When they learned our flights were cancelled .the price went from £47.00 per night to a staggering £83.46 for the same room . when we complained response was you want to sleep in a bed or the airport tonight take it or leave it   ,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"We stayed overnight because of an early flight next morning.  It cost us about £100 for our double room.  It was nothing special but had all one needed for a short stay like ours.  The bar and restaurant down stairs were again nothing special but adequate for our needs.  We were able to leave our car very close to the Hotel and the cost for 8 days was about £90.  Next morning the shuttle (which had frequency of about 15 minutes) arrived and for the cost of £3 each we were at the terminal in about 10 minutes.  So there was nothing special about any of this but it was efficient, adequate and at a reasonable price .  For a one night stay like ours, what more could one ask.  Strongly recommended!","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Arrived at 3am after flight. Excellent service at the desk, room clean and bed very comfortable. Unfortunately we had member of staff banging on our door at 9.30am asking us when we were going to vacate! The other members of staff apologised and confirmed the room was ours til noon. Perhaps new cleaning staff should have a bit more training. However, despite this we would stay there again.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"Clean and nice bedroom. BUT YOU CANT OPEN THE WINDOW. when i walked in it was freezing due to a/c turned on.  no facilities at all. you have to pay to do anything more than sleeping.  The shuttle to and from the airport costs 3£ each way. and it is quite slow. in the morning it takes 30 min to go to the North terminal.

"Arrived for stay before early morning flight.Very quiet location, just off the airport. Shuttle bus stops right outside the door. Takes about 10 minutes to South terminal after a couple of stops.

We stayed at this hotel prior to flying out to Dubrovnic. We think it had recently been refurbished and what a great job that was done. The room was very clean and comfortable though a little small which was fine by us. The restaurant is large and the food provided most acceptable. We would definitely stay here again.

"Initially went to the shuttle bus stop Number 8 as indicated on the Travelodge website, this was incorrect and should have been 9 (Gatwick South). Receptionist efficient. Wanted a bath. Water only warm. Water in hand basin Hot. Only way to have a hot bath was to use the shower curtain to run water from the hand basin to the bath. In doing this you realise the shower curtain really smells because it is dirty and there is no proper air circulation in the room (no opening windows). Once in the bath you can see under the hand basin and realise it also has not been cleaned. Bed - really uncomfortable as we kept rolling into the centre and waking each other up, mattress needs replacing. Breakfast - This was very good, as much as you wanted, warm to hot food and good value considering","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

It took around 20 minutes to travel in the morning and 15 in the evening via shuttle so plan accordingly.

Once arrived,  we were welcomed by the lovely Katie which made the check in really hassle free. She explained everything that we needed to know and we were thinking of going out to have some dinner but she insisted we try their restaurant as it has a new menu and a new look. We were skeptical whether to go or not,  we were tired so we decided just to give it a try. I need to mention that I have been before in traveloge restaurants and the food and experience wasn't that pleasant.   And what a good decision that was!

On both occasions I felt it was lacking. No fried eggs or mushrooms?  My biggest grip was leaving.

"This was our second visit. We thought we’d give you another go, hoping the first time was a one off. How stupid was I.   After having surgery just 5 days before our holiday, I hoped that staying at an hotel would take the stress out of traveling to the airport. This stay was far from that.   We checked in via the machine because of the line to check in at the desk. This service was one of the good things about our stay. We found our room and dropped our bags off. After the traffic on the M25 we just wanted to eat and chill. We were seated straight away but I had to ask for the table to be cleaned as there was ketchup over the table which was now on my son’s jumper sleeves. No apology, just a tut and rolled eyes from a member of staff. We ordered our food and waited. 24 minutes","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

This Travelodge was well worth the cost of the overnight stay we needed before a train journey. The staff were really good and the hotel in very good condition. The only negative was the fact the the airport bus did not arrive on time so aim to get a bus before the one you really need to get to the Airport - this of course is not within the control of Travelodge.,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Having had good experiences when staying at Travelodge hotels in the Pacific, I was appalled at the accommodations at the Gatwick Travelodge. I was travelling with my sister and had booked a twin-bedded room. Apparently, the only twin-bedded room available was a room for handicapped visitors with extremely narrow beds, and a barrier-free bathroom which, regrettably, was out of soap.   The restaurant also didn't measure up: extremely dry bbq chicken, bland curry, and a pathetic breakfast buffet.   Although the staff were all very pleasant, this is possibly THE WORST hotel I've ever stayed in. I certainly would not go back there.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

This is an excellent hotel well situated for Gatwick airport. Be warned the courtesy bus has to be paid for as well as the parking (expected due to its position).

"I stayed here with my family twice during May at each end of a trip to the U.S.  The hotel is comfortable and clean and has undergone a significant overhaul during the last 12 months.  The rooms were spacious and the bar and restaurant did exactly what we needed them to do.  There is a reasonably priced shuttle bus that runs to both the North and South terminals and which, as I understand it, operates on a very frequent basis throughout the day and night.  I am not sure whether it runs around the clock but we used it at both 0700 and then again at midnight.  Before booking I had a good look around the usual comparison sites and it is fair to say that the Travelodge was extremely competitive on price and looked considerably more appealing compared to some of the more expensive","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

Currently staying at the hotel. Check in was a nightmare. Self service machines not working which meant a massive queue. One person on the desk who didn’t even apologise after the 10 minutes of waiting. No explanation of car parking which we found out later wasn’t working so had to ring through to a given number. No explanation about restaurant or breakfast. No explanation of airport bus. Not even hope you enjoy your stay. I’ve rated 2 because the room was good and the breakfast was good. Needs to improve its service levels. Maybe this was an off day as most other reviews say otherwise but I can only go by my own experience. Won’t stay again and would pay extra for elsewhere.,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"We stayed here for about 6 hours before a flight to holiday.  We had difficulty finding the hotel by bus and ended up at the bus stops for Crawley rather than the shuttle buses. The stop is near the drop off and collection by car point.   Fast check in using the self service machines.  The room was very spacious, clean and modern. However the bed was rather uncomfy for us, and the walls were very thin. Either that or other guests very loud in their rooms and the corridors late at night.  It was nice that there was a shaving charging plug. The shower was very nice with a wide coverage and nice and hot.  The bus stops right outside and is a quick jouney (£3) to the airport. Not a great night but it did the job.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

Gatwick Airport Travelodge certainly didn't disappoint. Spacious room, huge, very comfortable bed and blackout curtains ensured a good night's sleep, as did the fact the room was very quiet, despite being on the ground floor and facing the car park. The 'all you can eat' breakfast is good value and quality too, and there is a roomy bar/restaurant area with a well stocked bar that is very reasonably priced.

Its easy to get to the hotel from the airport there is a shuttle bus that runs 24hrs and charges £3 per person per way!  When we arrived at the hotel there was a long queue at reception so we opted to use the self check-in machines, it allowed us to get to the point where it was allocating us a room and then crashed and told us we had to check in at reception! We were in room 154 which appears to be in a newer part of the hotel, it was a bit of a trek and also upstairs with no lift but wasn’t too bad! Due our coach to the airport being severely delayed we arrived quite late but the restaurant was still open!

"The GF and I have stayed here twice before flying from Gatwick, partly because of price but also because you know what you are getting. I was slightly peeved to have had two previous reviews removed due to an upgrade so was quite intrigued at the refurb.  I have to say that the refurb to the public areas, specifically the restaurant which was soulless and uninviting is a massive improvement and we enjoyed our meal. Food was enjoyable and reasonably priced. Over £5 for a pint is a bit steep.  I also think that Travelodge could afford to remove the over night parking fee or increase the room rate slightly as they are far cheaper than most hotels around. Good hotel, we will stay again if we brave the M25!","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"Lovely refurb of restaurant. Lovely food. Nice comfy rooms.  However, when it came to ordering spirits with mixer, they insist in pouring half the blooming mixer in.    I do not want my mixer poured in by your staff thanks despite what the duty manager says.    To me it is up to the customer to do this when they are back at the table. Retrain needed by the staff and manager on this issue. Perhaps in future ask your customer before acting.  I appreciate people may disagree.  Marked down because of this.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

Okay I booked last minute for a business trip but... don’t believe the name of the hotel. It’s nowhere near Gatwick Airport Central. You have a choice of a long walk along a dual carriageway with no pavement or you pay £3 for a mile long bus transfer. The room I got was a disabled room which threw me when I arrived at midnight. The bathroom arrangement was not what I wanted or expected. My double bed was two singles pushed together but still made up like two singles with separate duvet covers. I then woke up at 5am for my flight only to discover that none of the lights were working. The TV light was on so the room had electricity it was just the lights that refused to work regardless of any circumstance combination of buttons I pressed.

We arrived to the hotel by taking the hotel shuttle, which although it is not free, it made traveling between the airport and hotel extremely easy and convenient.  When we arrived, the staff was very friendly and informative and the room was comfortable and clean.  We walked to a nearby pub - Ye Olde Six Bells, rather than partaking in the dinner offered on-site.

There was a shuttle service to the airports and luckily we were up and ready quite early to get this.

"This is a hotel near the GTW airport. The airport shuttle drops off and picks up at the front door of the hotel so it’s very convenient. The room was clean and common areas were clean and updated and I really thought we would have a hassle-free stay. A couple of problems we encountered: (1) the AC seemed to not have been working that night so it was a little warm but we were too tired to care because we had bigger issues with our room. The following morning, there was a couple who was complaining about the AC not working and demanded a refund. (2) The shower drain was plugged. The management should have regular maintenance of all drains at least every week. Hair in drains are normal but when you let it accumulate to a ball then you’ll have drain problems.

Taxi service from the hotel to the airport was good and same cost as the shuttle.  Room was very comfortable although be carefull with the shower as it also sprayed on the floor and had to be mopped up with the towel.  Food was overall good but the burger was flavourless and the chicken wings lovely but at £5 for 5 not value for money.

"The hotel, including our room, was very spacious and clean. Housekeeping had forgotten to remove the towels used by the previous guest, which were piled on the floor of the room. It wasn't a big deal, so I just put them outside in the hall. The problem was the shower: the water temperature wasn't adjustable AT ALL, and the temperature was uncomfortably hot. I didn't need to wash my hair so I got out of there in a couple of minutes, but my daughter did and took a long time to cool down after her shower. The shower gel/shampoo dispenser (it was a combined device) was completely empty. Fortunately, we had brought our own. Housekeeping needs to tighten its act a little.

Overall very good, nice clean functional room with a pod style bathroom, it was a little  clinical but served it's purpose. We had a couple of drinks in the bar of which there was unexpectedly good choice, Goose Midway IPA on tap... The food was pretty good and the staff were very friendly.

I pointed out that I'd booked and paid in advance TWO MONTHS before, how can any hotel overbook? Who is not going to turn up to their hotel at an airport? First come first served apparently, so don't arrive late evening and expect to have the room you have paid for! Got a very insincere apology and told we would be taxi'd to Travelodge Crawley. Also told to sit in the bar. Didn't want a drink  but no staff present anyway. Got to Travelodge Crawley.

Typically standard Travelodge, which is no bad thing. Clean and functional rooms did what we needed at a reasonably good price. Impressive check in kiosk speeded up the process.

The bathroom was very clean with a shower instead of the normal bath.  The bed was so comfy with really good pillows, which is so unusual in hotel rooms.  Flat screen tv on the wall and the bar and restaurant is very modern.  Overall was very impressed.

We tried to call the hotel once we arrived at Gatwick but for some reason, the calls were not going through to the hotel. The ""regular"" shuttle service, which is really more like an airport/city bus, would have cost our family of four, 15 Euros. We decided to walk since the website said just one mile and after flying we were okay with a walk to stretch our legs. However, there is no paved sidewalk that goes all the way to the hotel and the cars practically fly by the road. I would never do this again.

Well, there were spaces but all the meters were 'not in use'. There was a telephone number on the meter and I used that to pay by phone.

We ate dinner in the hotel restaurant and really enjoyed our meals, and especially that the children's meals were free with our two-course adult meals - great value! We also made the most of the included breakfast the next morning.   From the airport, we took an £11 taxi to the hotel as it seemed complicated getting a bus. However, returning to the airport the next morning, we spent £9 on the hotel transfer bus, which was very easy.

We use this hotel as a stop over for an early flight the next morning. The hotel has been refurbished throughout and looks nice and modern now. The bar area is very nice as are the rooms. Always comfy so no complaint there.  The only couple of downsides are firstly the drink prices in the bar. They have a captive audience and take advantage of that unfortunately. The only other moan is the charging of WIFI in the hotel. I'm sure they can do this for free within the price of the rooms. You do get a short period for free but when you have kids this isn't a help.

We stopped at the Travelodge before flying to Greece. It's a new look hotel and you can tell that they have put the time in. It's nicer than any Travelodge that I have previously stated in. When we arrived there was both normal and digital check in which allowed large groups of arrivees to check in quickly. The rooms are smart and all equipped with super cool air con. The only downside to the room is the shower curtain was pretty poor and got in the way. There is limited free WiFi but that was not an issue for us. We had a good night sleep and couldn't hear any noise from the airport. We had an early start and the shuttle bus at just £3 was great. I would stay at this Travelodge in the future. ,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"This is a bleak hotel that does not offer free 24 hour wifi. Overpriced, without breakfast included. Much better options elsewhere for the same price. Feels like a hospital. No fridge in the room. Shower design leaks water all over the floor and the rooms are small","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Cannot rate this highly enough, brilliant place to stay a short distance away from gatwick airport. Bus picks you up directly outside and takes you to the airport for £3. Staff were very friendly and helpful, food was amazing for the price. Will definitely be staying again. ","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
Lovely large clean room. Comfortable beds and well equipped . Everywhere is fresh and clean looking after a recent refurbishment. Good frequent bus service to Gatwick. Great start to the holiday and I would not hesitate to book again.,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"good ,clean ,cheap hotel ,a bit hard to find the way in - more signs needed ,ac didn't work properly ,,nor bathroom extract ,beer selection needs to be better ,soap dispensers useless as always .but still handy for LGW ,so would use again","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"A sure measure of good accommodations is how long a coffee cup stays in the hallway...  Coffee cup won on this trip - longer than my stay.  Nothing glowing to report, the hotel serves as a bed and roof for an early morning flight. The location could definitely be cleaner, as visible stains on the carpet and damp mildew hung in the air of the 6th floor.   We spent one night there - had an early flight - a room with 2 beds is 1 queen and 2 cots. There is probably a fee for a cleaner room - everything is an add on.   The hotel is an airport destination, so as noted l, if you need a bed, need a roof within 5 mins of the airport this works - just plan to be asleep for your duration.

"Great value for money, spacious rooms, friendly staff. Downdide, Windows don't open and air con centrally set. Having it running overnight disturbed my sleep but if you don't need it on  it would be fine. Breakfast was plentiful but orange juice was very watered down and bacon like cardboard. Good selection of cereals and teas. Very very clean everywhere. Would stay again if in the area.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
we stayed at this travelodge because of a cancelled flight and found it to be very comfortable. the staff were excellent. They were able to tell us the best places to eat in the local area and give us information about bus routes and so on. If you're flying from gatwick this is a good place to stay.,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Great room that was easy to get to and from the main Gatwick airport.  Shuttle bus runs throughout the night, which picks up from front door of hotel, so was perfect for an early morning flight. Room clean, fresh. No breakfast option as left too early for the designated breakfast time so bear this in mind if travelling early.  Check website for times. Recommend and will use myself again if flying from Gatwick. ","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"We have stayed in many around the UK, usually for a few nights for a mini break. Only downside to this one was that it felt like a bit of a waste as everyone will probably only stay for 1 night! Staff were lovely, 'super room' was 'super'. We'd had a long trip to get there so didn't go out and ate in the restaurant after a few drinks in the bar. No complaints, would stay again","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"My partner and I stayed in this hotel before and early flight out Gatwick the next morning. It did everything you would want.  The rooms are quiet, clean and tidy with a decent TV. The bar/ dining room is a good size and food is average and are large portions.  Disappointed in lack of more than 30 mins free WiFi but it is a cheap hotel so didnt expect anymore. Shuttle bus from the hotel is mega convenient and run regularly.  ","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
Stayed 4 days in the hotel. No cleaning at all. Only bed was done and towels changed. Took the cleaning staff not more than 2 minutes to do the room. No cleaning at all in bathroom and room. Since there is no toilet brush I was not able to clean the toilet myself.,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
We stayed at Gatwick Travelodge the night before flying to Italy.  We could have left our car and taken the shuttle bus which runs frequently to and from the airport but we had already arranged parking before booking the hotel.  The hotel is modern and clean.  We had no noise interference from aircraft at any time during our stay and slept well.  The rooms are air conditioned and there is a bar and restaurant.  We had a good breakfast in the hotel but ate dinner at the nearby Ye Olde Six Bells in Horley (about a mile away) the evening before. We would definitely stay at the Travelodge again.,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
10 out of 10. Stay hear. Great value. Would recommend. Clean friendly and easy access to Gatwick airport via shuttle bus. Did not use Wi-Fi but is available at cost.

"This is a convenient, reasonably priced stop over near Gatwick. We always use it if we are flying the following morning. The rooms are clean and has everything you need. We were especially grateful for the air con due to the heat wave.  The rooms have tea/coffee making facilities, and you can also pick up extra bits from reception if you run out. The staff are friendly and check in/out is always quick and easy. The shuttle bus picks up regularly right outside and I think it was £3 for adults and £1.50 for children.

"Travelodge near Gatwick Airport was a place of calm between two very busy travel days!  The hotel shuttle bus was easy to find and use!  Our welcome and check in was quick and friendly.

Honestly, our stay was amazing!","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"We booked in here as we were coming from Glasgow and had an early flight in the morning to Cuba. When we arrived at the airport bus station there is a confusing sign especially for tourist which says, call for your bus! Most buses arrive at a certain time it your bus is in the circular route of the airport. We wendy sure at first like every one else but waited ten minutes and our bus appeared. A flat fee and we were dropped off right at the door. We checked in at the online part and went straight to our room. Standard clean large room. Basic but all you need. The iron board was outside in the corridor which we used and returned but I think you have to ask for one. Also I discovered you need to go to reception with soaking wet hair for a hairdryer.

We chose to stay at this Travelodge because it was convinient and sounded good value.We were keen to watch the airplanes and we were recommended to stay in a super family room which was facing towards the landing planes.The room was very clean and modern and the food was very nice.If we had another morning flight we would definitely stay again.,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"I chose this Travelodge based on some very positive reviews and was not disappointed.  Our family room on the top floor was quiet, very comfortable, and surprisingly spacious. The room is thoughtfully set up and modern, with various spaces where you can charge your laptop or phones, and plenty of lighting options so you could make it as bright or subdued as you liked.  Ample provision of large towels, comfortable beds, powerful shower over bath -  and a few extra thoughtful touches, like providing water in the lobby and hot chocolate as well as a nice coffee machine (plus of course a separate kettle) in the room.  Very close to the airport but no airport noise at all. We would definitely stay again. ","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
I stay at least 15 days a month in the Travel Lodge Central at London Gatwick. It’s okay but housekeeping gets worse by the day. They do not make the bed and just throw in a couple of new towels and pick up the trash. That if the come by the room at all. Worse is that the drains are pitch black from dirt and a few days back old human nails came floating into the bathtub whilst I was taking a shower. I myself have a strong stomach but I would never make my family stay here. ,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Arrived 9.20pm after a long & tiring day I arrived at Gatwick travel lodge, needing to eat sleep and leave at 4am At 9.30 pm I was told that the restaurant had ""run out of food"". After some persuasion I was offered a panini. How can an airport hotel run out of food? One hour later it arrived. How can it take an hour to make a panini? Then my room key wouldn't work. Told it has been to close to my phone Appalling!!!! I shall never stay in a travel lodge again.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

I have stayed here on many occassions. The rooms are nice eapecially the super rooms and the staff always friendly. Having just been down for dinner I have to say what they have done with the bar / cafe is fantastic. It has gone from looking like a works canteen to being a fun and trendy place to go.  The only criticism I have is the air conditioning. The first room they put me in the control panel had no display and the fan made a horrific noise. I also found a thick layer of dust on the air filter. They moved me to another room where the unit just whines continuously. Again the air filter is thick with dust which can't be helping. I would recommend that the hotel get all the air conditioners cleaned and serviced. The only downside to an otherwise excellent hotel.,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

Excellent hotel. In a Perfect location. Self Parking right outside. No need to leave keys.

"Stopped here for one night while waiting for a flight. Greeted with a smile from a happy chap on reception, quick and pain free check in. Having to pay for parking is disgusting but you don’t have a choice.  New refurb is really lovely but the bathroom had an awful smell constantly. The eatery downstairs really is dire but unless you want to pay airport prices it’s your only option. The restaurant staff really don’t have a clue what they are doing. Walking around looking at the empty plates and unhappy faces. when asking for our side dish we were told by the manager to “wait as she was super busy.” Ten minutes later when we had nearly finished our meal the side dish was brought over and then we were barked at asking if anything else was wrong and if there was anything else we","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"We revisited this hotel hoping that the refurbishment would show big improvements but the opportunity to move up a level has been missed.  The room did feature airco - a real must in the current heatwave - but the bathroom in particular was a botched job with no ventilation to prevent the whole room from steaming up, a shabby shower and poor quality workmanship giving a cheap finish to an obviously costly makeover. The room price does not include bus tranfer costs to the airport (unlike neighbouring Holiday Inn) which added £24 to our stay there. A bit disappointing!","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Arrived with my family for an overnight stop for the airport in the morning.  Requested a Happy 10th Birthday banner to be displayed in the room which I sent to the hotel before we stayed which was in our room on arrival. My daughter was very surprised and also very happy to see it waiting there. It made her Birthday. Thank you.   Check in was quick but the receptionist could have been a bit more chatty.  Had a problem with the car park ticket machine which another receptionist,  Katie helped with. She was very nice and friendly and helped us to solve the problem.

So we booked this hotel from recommendation from travel lodge this hotel isn’t on the actual Gatwick airport site it is one mile away from the airport   You have to go to bus stop 8 on the south terminal and pay three pound per a person to get to it so make sure you have this to get on a bus.   Buses are 24 hours around every 15-20 min   I have included the timetable from the travelodge to airport   We went to reception to ask for a iron at half 8 still two hours later still no iron brought to us as promised.

When I was there on one night there was a group of high school kids that spent most of the night and morning in the hallway talking. All noise in the hallway sounds like it is in your room! I found the staff to be rude, I had a problem with my air conditioning unit and the first lady that I asked said she would sort it, needless to say she didn’t and then when I tried to get someone else to sort it she got annoyed that she had to sort it further!

"This was the usual Travelodge experience, no frills but good value and convenient. Thing is, when you get there and find out about the parking charge for an overnight stay, which is basically payment for 24 hours minimum, it kind of knocks the edge off and makes it not quite as good value as it was. Yes, it does tell you about it in the mass of text on the booking form, but it should be much clearer, especially when you consider it was over 20% of the cost of the room. We seem to have come to accept being ripped off at airports with the cost of food and drinks, and this is just something else now on that list.

"I was very happy with my short stay at Gatwick Airport Central, after a short flight from Italy. I checked in at about 11:00 pm and both staff behind the bar and at reception were polite to me at all times.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"I used this hotel twice when I had flights departing LGW early in the morning and landing back quite late evening.  I also paid to leave the car at the hotel for 5 days which seemed good value and there seemed to be plenty of parking.  Rooms were clean and functional and staff very pleasant and helpful.  The hotel can arrange taxis (Evo) as well as the shuttle bus.  The cab is £6 and if you grab a card from them, you can order a return taxi which is much cheaper than the airport's own option. I would definitely stay here again.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"The hotel has been decorated to a very modern style, very bright and upbeat with friendly helpful staff.  Food in restaurant gives you a good choice and the £12 for 2 courses is a good option.  Only 15 minutes from the South Terminal and it has the bonus of a shuttle bus that runs approximately every 15 minutes 24 / 7!  This is an additional cost of £3 but is stress free and ensures that your journey to the airport goes smoothly.  Nice place to stay.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"One day I WILL have a Travelodge mattress of my own. Apparently this review needs to be 200 characters long, so I will have to wax lyrical some more about how much I genuinely love me a travelodge mattress.

Stayed in a super room. Worth the small amount extra. Really comfortable beds. Great night sleep given how close it is to the airport it was very quiet.  Easily reached using the bus service. Breakfast room well presented. Limited offerings for breakfast but nice quality. Took 10 minutes on the bus to the airport the next day. Would recommend and stay again.,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"We stayed at this hotel the night before our Gatwick Airport departure. We spent 2 weeks vacation in various hotels and this one was, BY FAR, the worst!   Upon arrival, the smell of mould and mildew was immediately noticed and we should have requested a room change. Unfortunately, we suffered through it. It left me feeling sick, which subsided considerably when we left for our outbound flight.   The floor in the bathroom seemed to have water damage as it was spongy under the flooring and felt uneven like it was rotted wood. You could see the water damage on the tub surround below.  The room smelled mouldy and the carpets were disgustingly dirty.   I would advise staying elsewhere if you can.   The only plus side, was that it was a convenient location and the restaurant had great","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

At about 0100,he's i was woken by a stranger opening my hotel door and walking in i shouted out and whoever it was disappeared . Again I complained and was told it might have been a cleaner?. What a shambles i could have been a thief and helped my self same as the mysterious person during the night. It looks like they have no idea who is in their rooms it's really poor.

"This hotel is ideally located for the airport. Really close and served by three airport buses (£3 adult) and quick check in and out. Takes about 15 mins and buses run every 15 mins.  Very reasonable price for a basic room which was perfect for my needs - comfy bed, very quiet and tea/coffee making facilities. Lighting and heating was very easy to regulate and there were plenty of sockets including USB. Bathroom and bedroom very clean.   Close to Horley and a Tesco Extra (within easy walking distance) if you need to do last minute shopping (although Horley did look at bit miserable in the rain).   There is a restaurant/bar on site with a reasonable menu and prices but I went out for dinner so can't comment.

"I booked overnight as I was meeting my daughter from a Gatwick flight at 6am the following morning.  The hotel was practical, clean, what you would expect from a hotel chain.  Nice lounge area where I set up camp with my laptop for the evening and enjoyed dinner and a drink.  Very busy and seems to be the perfect stopover. Room was big, tea and coffee facilities, bed comfy. Down-sides - just a thought!  No toiletries in room so if you had a flight in the morning it's a bit of a pain having to rummage in your luggage.  Noisy - walls thin so could hear lots of comings and goings throughout the night.  Parking - £8 for overnight which I thought was very pricey for residents. Overall - would definitely stay again.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
Booked this room in January as knew we were going to be flying out early Newly refurbished so everything was high spec in comparison to other travelodges we have stayed at so in this respect nothing to complain about One reason why I wouldn’t return was the return journey if the shuttle bus which really could be included in the price or maybe they could consider giving a discount ?,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"We always use this hotel as we book early morning flights it has been refurbished since we last used it and is very modern ,it is ideally located with a Tesco up the road and a few petrol stations around the area .Food is good and although it is in constant use from people arriving and leaving throughout the night you still get a good night sleep.( Only bad point is you get the mandatory squeaky door as per normal in a Travelodge lol ).Will always use this hotel great value for money.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Booked the room to be closer to Gatwick, before flying off next morning, it certainly was a relaxing way to start. Enjoyed breakfast next morning before picking the bus up, at the front doors to take us to the airport. The cost for the bus was £3 each, Well worth it. Will definitely do this again.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

We arrived very late and still managed to get an evening meal in the restaurant, we had a two course meal £12 for each adult and kids ate free.  Lovely fresh food.  All of the restaurant staff was really helpful and very polite  in checking for food that was nut free for my son.  Also had breakfast the following morning, everything laid out great.  All so clean and tidy.  Room was great the only comment we had it would have been nice to have a suitcase  stand.  Will definitely be returning again.  Well done and thankyou to all the staff.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

Stayed here as we had a flight at 3am to Spain. Arrived at 4pm and check in was very quick. We had a family room as we were travelling with 2 children and we had a double and two singles- still plenty of room available to move around. We went down to the restaurant at 5 and ordered dinner- 1 hour later still no food and other people who ordered after us had theirs. We asked 4 different restaurant staff for an update and finally staff member number 5 took ownership and sorted the issue. Drink offered as an apology which we accepted.  Great transport connection to Gatwick. Bus came on time and got us to the airport in plenty of time.  I would recommend this hotel and would have given it a 5/5 if not for the restaurant issue.,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"Stayed at the Travelodge for one night before our early morning flight from Gatwick Airport. Check in was quick and easy via a self service terminal which printed our room key. Room was a large size, with air conditioning, tea/coffee/hot chocolate and Kit Kats. Our room was for two adults and two teens (14 & 17), beds were comfy - although found the pillows uncomfortable. We had an evening meal in the restaurant and was greeted with a free small glass of Pimms. We all had a burger, which arrived quickly and was the type of meal I expected. Would definitely stay here again if needed to.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"So it’s an airport hotel which means they only expect guests to stay one night. One would normally be enough, but I had the pleasure of the terrible service for 2 nights. The rooms are fine and very typical of Travelodge as is the check in process etc etc. The f&b provision is where it struggles. Staff seem miserable, you may wait an hour for food and if you ask for whisky you get it in a shot glass! Nobody seems to care whether you’re there or not which is a shame as it has so much potential","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Great stay in a family room. Room was very clean, except some spillage of soap in the bathroom. The recent refurbishment made the cafe look fabulous and there was nothing to fault . Staff was very friendly and even let my mum borrow her personal umbrella while we went to blacks burgers for a bite to eat. Staff were great .  I highly  Recommend NOT getting the shuttle bus if you are a party of 2 or more. The shuttle is £3 each, HOWEVER, evo taxis have a fixed fare of £6 from the Travelodge to both terminals. There is an iPad to book these on in reception. They are on time and take less than 10mins compared to 20mins with the bus.   Would recommend this hotel highly.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Check in slower than usual because automated check in not working, however the 2 receptionists were polite,  friendly and efficient.  Our room was large,  very clean and comfortable. Definitely refurbished since our last stay. We had a garden view this time and heard a few planes which we hadn't heard when we had a car park view. Apart from noisy neighbours we had a great stay before our flight.  Airport shuttle bus is £3 or £6 for a taxi. ","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

The room was big enough to put our four suitcases in as well and we had a good nights sleep, despite being close to the airport there was no air traffic noise and the the hotel was quiet, no slamming doors in the night .Drinks were available in the room and kitkats had been left, which were much appreciated.all in all , a good stay and would happily recommend.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Stayed here the night before we flew to Malta and I was more then impressed! A lot cheaper then other hotels in the area with unlimited breakfast next day and each paying adult a child has it free. We had dinner the night before which was super busy but they worked hard. The shuttle bus was handy as you couldn’t walk to the terminals and wasn’t it expensive, busy bus  but it’s taking a lot of people.

Perfect start to our holiday 😊","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"The bar area's brilliant, especially for a travelodge!  A very pleasant place to spend the evening on your own or with others.  Really nicely designed.  The food is cheap - but I do mean cheap.  Tasty enough but the price matches the quality.  Better to pop out to Tesco or McDonald's I would say, if you can.  The bedroom we stayed in was okay - air con was welcome (it was very warm outside) but it squealed all night.  Bit annoying.  The shower had more hair in the plug than is acceptable (1 is unacceptable but a whole clump is much worse).    Bring shampoo/shower gel.  The hotel does provide something on the wall but it isn't pleasant. I'm not picky on this by the way - it really just wasn't pleasant.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"We booked this hotel as we had a late flight arriving at Gatwick and preferred to stay in a hotel rather than travel home in the early hours of the morning. We booked the Travelodge as it was listed as Gatwick Airport Central, thinking it would be right on the doorstep of the arrivals area. Unfortunately not! It was a bus ride (only going every hour) or a taxi ride away and there was no way of walking there. Very disappointing as we ended up having to pay £17 for a taxi and did not arrive until an hour after we left the airport due to the wait for taxis. Apart from this the hotel was clean and comfortable, just a shame about the location!","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Booked this hotel for one night before a long flight. Travelodge's have moved on in recent years and this one is top notch. Check in was easy, staff were friendly and my room was very close to reception and the restaurant. The facilities were of a good standard the the bed was very comfortable. Free wi-fi for a very short time and then payable. I ate in the restaurant (a little pricey, but there are drink and meal deals available), the food was good and there was plenty of choice. Transport to and from the airport is regular and costs £3 each way - just pay the driver. There are several airport hotels around Gatwick but this one was coming up cheaper than any of the others for me and I'm really glad I booked and have no hesitation in recommending it.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Affordable, clean and comfortable. The staff is also friendly. Only 10 mins to airport by shuttle bus.

It’s always out 1st choice hotel to stay before we fly. We just recently stayed here after the uplift it’s had and it’s great. Can’t wait to come back in October. It’s very easy to get to.

Arrived at 6am for breakfast, sadly earlier than either the waiting staff or food. these turned up at 6.05am - not great when you have an 8am flight and planned to eat here.

Free tea and coffee at any time or when open from the restaurant area.

The rooms are clean, the location to the airport is great with buses every 10 mins (£3 each way) taking you to the airport or if you are up for a walk 20 minute leg stretch.

It was over an hour before we were seated for food, in the end we found our own table.  Once seated we chose our food and went to the bar where it said 'please order your food here.  We queued and waited but there was only one bar server and everyone appeared to be ordering their food at the bar where you got served for drinks. After questioning this the barman said he was the only bar person and was trying to accommodate both areas of the bar.

We ate in the restaurant which had a nice varied menu and a separate menu for the children. I certainly don't think you could beat the price of £59.00 per room.

From the minute that we checked in, through ordering the meal to getting out food was a very positive experience.  We found all pf tye staff to be engaging and friendly  but particular credit must go to Tom who works in the cafe bar.

A couple of issues.....the heating wouldn’t work. The control unit wouldn’t switch to heating. The food downstairs is very limited and the sitting area/design is terrible. No breakfast offered till 0600 which is great for people flying at 09:00. The car park is a rip off when the sign says £8 but you call up the number and charges you £12. The water pressure was shockingly bad. The bed was good though. ,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Having been here before and to other Travelodge Airport and non-Airport Hotels, this is really not a bad, dumpy hotel. Part of the problem are the customers of the beer drinking types. Obviously, Travelodge make a lot of money selling cheap booze at airport prices and that is their business. However it does not really make a good impression for well-behaved transit passengers and especially the behavior of drunks on their way to stag/hen parties in Europe is rather obnoxious.The best thing to do is to get your own drink and food beforehand from the airport so you can stay in your room and not pay inflated prices and avoid the drunken Boys and Girls.My main complaint is that the staff are impersonal.

"We had an early flight so stayed over to avoid getting up super early at home. Luckily we got dropped off as there were no parking spaces available, you would need to prebook if planning to park there. Check in quick and easy and you ask the receptionist to book the taxi for you now. The refurbishment was definitely needed, the rooms are large but empty, just a large bed and a small desk. Would prefer the bedside shelves to be a little larger. Only downside was a lot of people slamming their doors and the questionable smelling soap in the bathroom. Get a taxi as it costs £6 and the bus is £3 each so for a couple it is the same price and more luxury","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
A lot further out than expected. Room was only average and toilet stinks of urine. Bus £3 per trip per person. Not as on time as you’d expect. I will never use this location again.

"I would normally rate my stay 4 stars.  It is a Travelodge Plus which means a modern room, even has 4 USB sockets, and booked 5 months in advance was great value for an overnight stay before an early flight (£41).  Has a cafe bar which serves both food and drink. The service is good and food and drink excellent. A nice smooth Merlot for £4 and tasty curry with perfect dry fluffy rice.  So what is wrong.... The rooms have air conditioning which supplies both cooling and heating except any heating was disabled. It was a cool evening so the room was cold. Complained to reception and the solution was to give me an electric heater.  Why not just revert the ac back to guest control as described in the room. After all the summer is over!

"We booked the Gatwick Travel Lodge through a third party and when we arrived after a late night flight, there was no record of our booking.  The receptionist was brilliant- she took copies of our confirmation email and made us feel very welcome.  She found us a room on the 5th floor and assured us it would all be sorted out.  The hotel is very big, but there was no noise and we had a great nights sleep.  The room was clean and comfy, and the tea and coffee facilities went down well.  Breakfast was plentiful and catered for all tastes.  We were very impressed that this budget hotel offered so much for such a good price. The real bonus was the staff, who were all friendly and helpful, and dealt with our lost booking very efficiently when we were tired and confused.

"Managed to get a room here with my boyfriend last minute a couple of nights ago after we had a flight transfer. It’s one of the nicest travelodges I’ve staying in. A lot more modern than some. The bed was super comfy and the AC kept the room at a lovely temperature. If you’ve got a flight at Gatwick it’s a perfect location being that you can simply jump on the bus that stops straight outside and takes you straight to the terminals. My only criticism was that there was a couple of strands of somebody else’s hair on the shower wall when we arrived, i wasn’t that overly bothered as the bathroom was otherwise spotless so I simply washed the hair away. Also I do think having only 30 minutes free WiFi is a little stingy, and then £3 for 90 minutes is no better. ","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
Did exactly what I needed. - cheap transfer bus (long may that continue) and quick check in process.  Only criticism would be if any the need for longer free WiFi to sort out any possible travel hiccups without it costing money as it’s stressful enough without realising you are spending more to sort it out. Other than that I will def be using again. ,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"Stayed for 1night prior to holiday.   Positives:  - Regular bus from Gatwick £3 each which allows quick access to hotel from airport/ train station - Room clean and quite large (although odd shape) - Cost £48 for 1night  Negatives - Food, awful. £32 dinner for two (burgers with two drinks). Poor quality, poor service and no interest when complaining (the whole 'restaurant' was up in arms) - Air con was centrally controlled. Room was too hot all night.  - Walls are thin, kept awake all night.   I complained the next morning and received a £48 vouchers to be used off a stay from another hotel. Although this gesture was appreciated, this doesn't resolve the terrible food.   Fine to stay for a night, but do not eat here - despite the surroundings looking quite appealing.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

Found litter and chewing gum in the litter bin , It was a twin room with 2 very small uncomfortable beds push together. You could hear people walking down the corridor .

"Booked a superior room to try. Pluses are coffee machine; Kit Kats; space and nice decor. Minuses were shower water pressure; no hand wash in the bathroom. Room was impressively dust free. Well lit and mood lighting when required. Double plugs and USB ports on both sides of the bed, which is a must for 2018. Aircon. Might be an idea to add two bottles of water for the room as it is one of the “superior” branded ones. We ate dinner. £12 each for two courses. Was very tasty. We ate breakfast £8.95 and is unlimited. Very close to the North Terminal of Gatwick and we used the bus service and it was £3 each way. Would definitely stay here again. Staff were 90% excellent.

"If you don't mind paying £3.00 per person for a bus journey to get from the airport to the hotel, and £3.00 per person to get back to the airport, then you will wonder what I'm complaining about.  But comparing with Premier Inn, the price benefit of Travelodge soon disappears.  Provide a cash credit on production of a bus ticket.Then we came down to breakfast - the room is very large, refurbished recently, but poorly laid out.  Travelodge managers should stay at Premier Inn to see what they do, putting in screens to break up the area, and not having the cutlery trays 30m away from the seating area.  It would also be an attractive option to have staff available to offer different options of eggs and other breakfast items, rather than just the standard dried-up scrambled egg.

That's just the highlights.  Room didn't have a phone, so forget about requesting a wake up call or phoning reception for anything.   The shower's ""hair and body wash"" had been diluted to the point where it felt like you were trying to rub water into your hair.

We could see it from the airport but weren't sure which road to take. As we approached, we lost sight of it because of trees and eventually decided to turn back and try another road - walking beside a dual carriageway - scary! We then found a little path cutting into the forest that took us into the hotel grounds and discovered that, had we known, there is a public footpath from close to the airport through the forest.

On our arrival we were greeted by a member of housekeeping who said that our room had been let to someone else.  We were very tired and very unhappy at this but according to the lady this is the normal practise for Travelodge to let the room to someone else if you are late, this cannot be correct procedure as we had paid for the room. She said that if there are no rooms left they will pay for a taxi to another hotel which at that time of the morning is not acceptable .  We did get a room after a fairly long wait, we were offered a complimentary cup","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

Stayed here one night prior to flying from Gatwick.  Much improved since it’s been refurbished.  Staff welcoming and helpful.  Really comfortable room and slept well despite the early rise.  Good value for money also.  Would definitely stay here again.,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
We stayed in a super room on the 6th floor. It had a large double bed and 2 single. On arrival there were kitkats and hot chocolate in the room. The food was the usual travelodge standard but nice. This was ideal for a quick airport stay.,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Fantastic stay in a clean, bright and modern room. Breakfast was available at an extra cost, and there was plenty to choose from. Our evening meal, at an extra cost, was also well priced and had plenty of choices. We had a long journey to get to Gatwick Airport, with an early morning flight out the next day. A regular bus takes you straight from the hotel door to the Airport at a nominal charge.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"I had a very early flight in the morning. So, I thought I'd stay the night here for convenience. Boy do I regret it!  You would have thought, situated at Gatwick airport, you'd make an effort to soundproof the rooms a little better. I could hear the traffic outside all night. With that, could hear everything going on in the corridor, the TV in the room next to me and this irritating clinking sound coming from the bedframe directly behind my head.  Literally didn't get a minute's sleep. So my trip the next day was a serious struggle! Was absolutely exhausted!  Really regret staying here. Complete waste of my money! Should have just stayed at home and risked getting the public transport in the morning.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"From the moment of our arrival, everything went like clockwork. The hotel reception and bedroom were welcoming and extremely spacious. Most importantly, although this hotel is extremely close to Gatwick airport, it was extremely quiet which was very important to me as I am both a very light sleeper and had an early start the following day.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Our stay at the Travelodge Gatwick Central Plus was very good.  Clean, tidy, brightly coloured retro style decor, food reasonably priced although didn't eat at the hotel myself but looked good. Shuttle bus to Gatwick airport took 10 mins and was easy to get from outside the hotel reception area. Bus stops at Gatwick airport clearly labelled with departure times depending on which bus required to get to whichever hotel you are staying at -  £3 per adult each way.

I recently stayed here prior to a 9am flight to Florida. The hotel was generally clean and the bed's were comfortable. In the morning  my 16 year old nephew who was travelling with me wanted a cup of tea when he woke up. I went to fill the kettle for him and noticed the bottom of the inside of the kettle was covered in mould. I'm glad I  went to fill the kettle as being 16 and half asleep my nephew probably  wouldn't have looked before boiling the kettle and would  have drunk from it. This could have potentially  made him very ill possibly even resulting in hospital treatment which would have ruined his first tip out of the country that had been planned for well over a year. It's sad as this was a very small thing that ruined an otherwise very good hotel stay ,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
Good value and comfortable but our room had a strange smell.Aircraft noise was minimal inspite the close proximity to Gatwick Airport. Breakfast (continental) was nothing special and choice was rather limited.,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"The rooms are what you expect. The staff are great. The real surprise is the cafe/bar area. Surprisingly comfortable even if the dining area is a little Spartan. The food was better than expected. The two issues ewe had were with the rooms. The lack of shower gel was irritating but not disastrous. The noise from other guests was more problematic. The doors are not insulated enough so you hear everyone walking along the corridor. Worst still I could hear the water from the shower and toilet upstairs. Overall good value. You get what you expect and it’s well located for the airport, which is probably the only reason people stay here. But very popular nonetheless ","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
This Travelodge seems to compete well on average as I compared many prior to staying here - it was a business stay but I still want value for money. The breakfast was very good value. If you are staying on business book parking on the APCOA app on arrival using hotel parking code from reception. This reduces the parking cost and provides a VAT receipt which you do not get from the parking machine.,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
Easy to reach from Gatwick rail (& airport ) station by shuttle bus. Friendly professional staff who were at times dealing with a lot of customers at once.

"Arrived fairly late and used the self service check in which we had no issues.  Went to the room and was pleasantly surprised, nice, clean and spacious- we had a super room. Not sure what the difference was to a standard one but there wasn’t much difference in the price.  I wasn’t feeling great and fancied a bath so I went to ask reception if they had a room with a bath. They went out of their way to ensure they could fulfill my request which they did so very pleased. The hotel room also had galaxy hot chocolate sachets and kitkats which I thought was a lovely added touch!  Good choice of channels on the tv and the bed was comfortable.  Transfer to the airport was £3 each which wasn’t bad and they had timetables available on reception to take away too!

"We stayed here for 1 night before flying from Gatwick, we had just endured a stressful start to our holiday  trying to get booked into the Russ hill hotel (see separate review). We booked online while sitting in the Russ Hill car park. Upon arriving they couldn’t initially find our booking as it was via holiday extras, but stated sometimes it can take a while to come through, the manager suggested that we have a drink in the bar while they wait for the booking. This was fine as they were very accommodating and friendly. Eventually the booking came though and we had our room.

After unpacking went into the bathroom, noticed virtually no toilet roll, soap dispenser at sink was empty/broken and to top it all, there was a sanitary towel floating in  the toilet. Disgusting! Informed reception, woman was not very interested/sorry but offered a change of room and/or discount.  We accepted 30% discount and stayed put as we had upacked and just wanted to sleep.  Return stay (234) was fine and no problems.  Prefer Premier Inns to Travelodge though.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

I went down and took the towel to reception where it was taken off me and agreed it was totally unacceptable.  That was how it was dealt with. So basically I paid for a what appears to have been a used room!!! ","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"We stayed for one night before an early morning flight.  The car park is all over the place, very poorly lit and expensive at £8 for the few hours we were there (less than 9 hours).  The hotel has been overhauled and the rooms are good.  The reception staff weren't overly helpful or attentive/  We didn't have anything to eat or drink, having brought our own with us. We booked in advance on the no refund basis so we got good value at £35 for the night. ","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

Had the misfortune of being booked in here for 11 days by my company while working in Surrey. Pretty bad when you have stayed a week and have to ask reception to have clean bedding put on !!  Rooms are spacious but that is about it. The restaurant (come Ikea Cafe) is bad. Queuing to order food at the bar and then being told to expect a long delay on food. Ended up eating out as they cannot cope with the volume of people staying. Overpriced drinks. No decent place to sit and chill after work just an open space of noise. This place may be ideal for one night stays to catch a flight out of Gatwick but other than that is has nothing else to offer. Car parking is a pain with only one pay point machine in use outside with no cover so prepared to get wet.

"Firstly the shuttle to the airport is £3 per person, but you can get a taxi for £6 for multiple people. You can book that on the iPad at the desk or if the front desk isn’t busy they will book one for you. DO NOT GET A TAXI FROM THE AIRPORT, they will charge you £12 ( double). Get the phone number from the hotel and call the taxi firm they work with.    We had booked two rooms ( 3 adults). We were both given ground rooms.  Mine was DAMP. I sat on the bed for 10 min and my clothes were damp. And it smelt really damp. Our other room was damp smelling but not even close to as bad as my room.  So I told the front desk and they moved me directly upstairs to the quiet floor. This room was much much better! You honestly wouldn’t have thought the two rooms were in the same building.

Recently stayed at this hotel the night before flying from london gatwick airport. The hotel is very close and is covered by the airport shuttle buses at the cost of £3 per person. The hotel is fantastic and offers very modern and spacious rooms. The beds in the rooms are really comfortable. Only advice for improvement i would say is have more staff available on the check in desk as we waiting approx 10 mins to check in due to all the self check in machines being unavailable due to a fault. Apart from that this hotel is great and would definitely stay here again if flying from London Gatwick airport.,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

First time staying since the upgrade but usually stay 3-4 nights 3 on this occasion. Ground floor room which is fine so don't have bother with the lifts but looking into the service tunnel and with having no net curtains had to keep the curtains closed all the time or people walking past looked right into the room. At night the lights were on so they also shone through the curtains. The A/C was either on or off no other function worked but at night had to be off due to the noise it made of the gasses gurgling through it. The room was clean though and so was the bedding and towels. Went for a meal and ordered the steak and ale pudding This was deliverd very quickly which is good for such a high turnover airport kitchen.

"We recently stayed in this hotel prior to flying out early of Gatwick airport. We knew there would be a fee for parking but we're not expecting to have to pay £8 for 24 hours when we were only staying for under 12 hours in total.As we walked into the room it appeared clean however the bathroom was covered in black hairs which I had to clean out myself before having a shower. Further to this the water pressure was next to nothing and I would have been better standing out in the rain!Trying to sleep in the room was another issue, there was constant creaking coming from the bed and if you wanted the air con on you had to deal with a bright green light shining at you.This is most disappointing as I have stayed in many travelodge hotels but this is by far very disappointing.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"We decided to book this Hotel after experiencing the M25 a few days before. The self service check in was not working which made the check in desk rather busy, but apart from this the Hotel suited our needs. Our room was clean, comfortable and quiet allowing us to get a good night's sleep before catching our early morning flight the next day. The bar and restaurant were more than adequate for a one night stay and the staff we dealt with were very helpfull. There is also a regular 15 minute shuttle bus to both Gatwick Terminals (£3.50 an Adult). I would book this Hotel again.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

After travelling for 5 hours, I went to check in early hours of the morning (just before 1am)- looking forward to sleep before my flight. However when I arrived I was told that there were no rooms available?! Travelodge did not even have the decency to inform me about this via phone or email. Apparently, this is a regular occurrence this hotel, as they book 10% over in hope that people will cancel or not show up. We had to wait around for nearly an hour to find out from head office where they were going to put us. Around 2am head office emailed the staff at Gatwick Airport to situate myself and 4/5 other couples into the super room's at the same hotel..

I have stuck with travelodge for always now after trying an alternative.Not much information given by reception regarding bar, meals availability etc. But biggest shock was £8 car parking charge that I managed to spot by luck. If I didn’t see it I’m sure I would have received a fine. I was only looking for a 4-5 hour short stay as my flight was early. I think the reception staff should let you know about parking charges and not assume you know. Other travelodges take  your registration number.

The breakfast room was excellent.  Very spacious with very large tables for large families.  It is an airport hotel so caters perfectly for large groups.

"The ventilation was broken, so the bathroom filled up with steam.  When we opened the bathroom door, the steam set off the fire alarm in the hotel room (although we did not hear any alarm), and they sent a security guard to check us out to see if we are OK.  Apparently this is a very common occurrence.  The hotel should either fix the ventilation, or else post signs saying ""Our ventilation is broken, please do not open the bathroom door until the steam has gone away or it will set off the fire alarm"".  This would keep the poor security guard from having to look at naked guests all morning.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

The bathroom was clean and the shower worked perfectly. The only problem was that the shower curtain hung outside the shower and made the floor very wet, there wasn't a bathmat to soak it up so the floor could be slippery. The breakfast was good plenty of choice.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"We booked in for one night because of a very early flight the next morning and it was extremely reasonably priced. The self check-in worked easily and quickly and check-out was just as simple. The bed was clean and comfy, but the room was very cold and we couldn’t get the heater to work. The bathroom had a damp smell. I might stay again in the same situation, but I’d also look at other airport hotels first. Don’t forget the shuttle bus between the hotel and airport costs £3 each way, so for two people that added £12 onto the stay.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"I stay at this hotel on a regular basis, it went through a huge refurbishment and staff change and for me was a great hotel to stay in. It seems a management change has taken place and everything has declined!?!  My concern is the lack of approach towards health and safety and fire. Un trained staff, shoddy equipment, and a lack of care during an evacuation really does concern.  The new reception manager is rude and aggressive ( I’m sure she used to be on the bar) is she even qualified? The bar has become a circus with poor standards, and staff who only care about the rink they are going to have when they finish, god only knows what the kitchen must be like now.....hope fully not as dirty as my room!   More frustratingly the only glimpse of the new general manager is when you","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

The usual night's stay before an early morning flight. The shuttle bus from South terminal (and North) to the hotel was easy to find from the information on the website and buses certainly seemed frequent enough (at £6 return fare).  I checked in electronically which was straightforward and reasonably speedy to zip through the various add-on options. The whole foyer area seems so much more spacious than pre-refurb. The room itself was large and airy (I booked a single room but it came with a large comfortable bed) and I slept really well. Bathroom fittings were all new so it was a most pleasant experience.  I ate in the dining area and the curry I had was excellent and reasonably priced.

"The room was reasonable for the price - clean, functional etc -and we liked that the associated parking was in front of the main entrance which seemed preferable and probably more secure than most airport parking which is miles away.  However, the food, which was not a reasonable price, was truly abysmal: the burger looked and tasted like it was made from pureed frankfurter, mashed potato appeared pre-digested, service appalling - had to ask for desserts 3 times before they came.  Soulless, joyless room in which to eat.  Take sandwiches or treat yourself to a taxi and eat somewhere else.  Or don't eat at all.  But don't eat here.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

Don't make the mistake of assuming it's walking distance from the Gatwick Terminals - it's a 15 minute bus ride away, and you need to pay for the bus - so be prepared.

Breakfast was plentiful and good. The restaurant space is big and comfortable and there is also a big lounge space that can be used to wait, hang out and pass time.

"The staff here are wonderful making this hotel a fun place to stay this morning I was greeted by Caroline who has such a approachable positive attitude who clearly takes pride in her job, and the thing that definelty stands out is Caroline takes interest in her guests which is absolutely brilliant because I felt today that the staff actually talk to you which is nice, you can have a laugh with the staff here especially the front desk staff!

"This hotel offers really competitive prices in a great location with easy access to Gatwick airport via a really frequent and easy to use shuttle bus. The rooms are spacious and nicely decorated. They are basic but still really cosy and it was a pleasure to stay there before our holiday. The bar and dining areas huge and the decor is lovely. I ate here for dinner and breakfast and we were really happy with everything. The staff are nice and kindly accommodated us by changing our rooms on arrival so we were all on the same floor. I have stayed here before and I will definitely stay again and recommend to family, friends and colleagues. The staff are friendly and helpful also which is a big bonus as you are made to feel very welcome.

"Have stayed here before - this weekend spent a stressful weekend house hunting in the area, so stayed 2 nights as a family, first room had a musty B.O smell to it, and the bath water was tepid... mentioned it in the morning on our way out and was told it would be looked at? Spent a day out - ensuring we left our little sign on the door stating we wanted our room made up - to arrive back to a room that wasn’t made up, no clean towels, no clean cups, no replenishment of drinks/coffee, and a cold bath - ended up being moved to a different room, just what we wanted after a long day, to another room with equally tepid bath water - I’m aware this isn’t a one off with regards to the water and the cleaning as my partner stays here often and has told me plenty of times he’s returned to","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

Excellent hotel at a good price i paid £25.50 thats discounted and it was clean and comfortable. The bus comes right outside the hotel reception and is £3 or you can catch a taxi for £6.   The room was clean comfortable and has everything you want for a pre flight stay or if your on business.   You can also pay an extra £10 for early checkin or late check out which is a good bonus has even some of the bigger hotels dont offer early check in.   I had lunch in the hotel in the afternoon and the food was nice and reasonably priced. For my dinner I ordered some food into the hotel. A good selection on just eat. ,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"I have stayed here many times. Never had to complain before .... But, my latest stay i decided to book in to one of the upgraded rooms. What a let down, very sparse. only one chair in the space and one by the counter. No sofa .... why ? There is so much space for it !  Coffee machine was missing, though the coffee pods were there and the instructions for the machine ..... again why .... if you offer a coffee machine then put one in there. Kettle was not working properly, had to hold the button down until it boiled.  Told reception about this around 7pm. Thinking they might fix the issues during the evening while I was at dinner (elsewhere) No chance. There excuse was that they didn't have enough working coffee machines .... not what I expect. And still no working kettle !!","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"Found it much easier to get around the hotel because the doors were lighter and easier to open and get through with my Canine Partners assistance dog. Had a wet room bathroom in my room with the door that also opened easier than some other places I have stayed. The staff were all very friendly too. Both my assistance dog and myself had a good time, there was plenty of grass outside in the car park surrounding the hotel.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
The hotel was fairly easy to find . A vast carpark made it difficult to locate a space . The parking is not included and the pay terminal is outside in the cold and dark .

Bar is 24h and the bar Man was very helpful and chatty, easily made our experience better and got outback holiday off to a good start (think his name wasn’t James? Not too sure but a young lad).

"This hotel is very easy to find. The hotel itself is very clean and spacious when entering.  We arrived just before 3pm and had a little wait before we got checked in. When got to the room the heater was on but only blowing warm air , the bathroom was very small with no extractor fan ,so it steamed up very quickly. Went to reception about the heater not working,  the receptionist (katie) was very helpful and supplied a electric heater. The heater on the wall was making a noise through the night even tho it was turned off. All in all it was a very pleasant stay and a good night sleep","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
We were very disappointed with our stay. On entering the room there was a horrible smell. We were so jet lagged that after getting to the room with all of our luggage and our 5 year old fast asleep we decided not to go back down to reception and ask for another room. The carpet was dirty in our room and so was the shower curtain. We had a family room which had a double bed and two single beds. There was a table desk in the room with kettle and phone on but there was no other furniture in the room.  We would not stay at the hotel again. ,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"We were ok with the room just disappointed with the service, there was such a hassle to get a hair dryer and when there was a change of shift the message was not passed on so had to keep chasing it.  Despite a card being left out to make our room up this was not done so had to chase that.

Seated by a friendly waitress and she explained what was what. Good choice of hot food, replenished regularly. Tables cleared quickly.

I reported it at reception and it took nearly 1hr and a half for this to be addressed. It turned out the issue was with the soap dispenser (there was enough soap in there), but it couldn't be fixed that evening.

"Hi, I am a single, female traveler and have used Travelodge hotels for many, many years.  A long time ago I was told their policy for single females was to not put them on the ground floor & your key card was given to you without others seeing which was your room. I arrived at 01.30 from a flight, was put on the 6th floor (not what I had booked) the room was cold and would not heat up. Then for the rest of the night I was kept awake by an A.C. unit! On my return journey I was told my room was on the ground floor! Then I was given a room that did not exist, then a room that the key card did not open.

I was surprised I had to pay to park, especially when I booked a room, but £8 for 24hrs isn't expensive.  The room was very clean. It was set up perfectly for myself, hubby and 6yr old. It was quiet for our stay and we slept well. It is close to the airport and other amenities (we used purple parking and it was 10 mins drive).

The staff at check in were very friendly and welcoming. The room itself was clean. However I attempted to sleep from 21:00 - 04:00 (I had an early flight) and slept for approximately 3 hours in total on and off due to the noise of the heating/air con unit which wasn't even switched on. Had I been staying on my own I would have requested a room change but my partner, who can sleep through anything, was fast asleep so I didn't want to disturb him.

The rooms are comfortable and warm in the winter and cool in the summer.  There are tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms but there is a cafe where you can buy drinks and food should you wish too.  It is an ideal stopover before you travel.  I prefer to stay at Gatwick overnight so i am not anxious about flights not arriving on time before my long haul flight later.  I usually stay at the Travelodge twice a year.

As we walked to our rooms I was absolutely disgusted to see the hallway filthy like it’s not been cleaned for about 2 weeks!

I had an early morning flight so booked this Travelodge for convenience but was blown away by the service of the staff. The check in was swift and the room extremely large and a very comfortable bed.  We had a meal and was looked after by Ben who was very friendly. Food has to be ordered at the bar but is served to your table. We ordered 3 different mains and all were impressed with the quality. I had 1/2 chicken with chips and salad. The salad was more than just a few lettuce leaves. The meal for the 4 of us with 2 courses and a bottle of wine was about £60. I had booked a car parking space and a taxi to the airport was £6.

"When we had to catch an early flight in late November back to Boston, we decided to stay close to Gatwick since travelling from Essex back to the airport can be a nightmare. I did a quick search and found this hotel-I have never stayed in a Travelodge before and was worried, so with a dab of hesitation, but buoyed by the good reviews, I hit reserve.   The room was very clean-bathroom was spotless. I was pleasantly surprised as was the husband. The shuttle picked us up from the airport and dropped us off at the hotel and back again the next morning without a hitch. We did not eat at the hotel because of our early morning flight so can't comment on the nibbles.   I'd definitely stay here again the next time we visit family in England-the price seals the deal.

I don’t think I have ever stayed in a travel lodge this big.  It has a spacious reception area where the staff are lovely but they did struggle a bit. The reception also has 4 self book in terminals but not sure how they worked.  The food (dinner) is reasonably priced even if the selection is limited and it isn’t half bad.  We had a super room. These are well worth the extra cost as they are large and well appointed! “Free” kitkat !! However I did have two gripes. The bathroom was freezing with no option to warm it up and the free Wi-fi was pathetic. Had to turn off the Wi-fi on my phone and use the 4g.  Overall ?

The restaurant was ok but the menu and food uninspiring but it’s not a hotel one would go for anything other than business or enroutebto somewhere else. It’s close proximity to the airport is also useful as was the shuttle bus. I would stay again.,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"Really really impressed with the service and quality of my stay every single time at this hotel! As a crew member, I do stay here often and wouldn’t go anywhere else out of choice.  The staff are always friendly and as accommodating as possible, both on reception and in the bar/restaurant. There is a great atmosphere in the 24hr bar, which makes it welcoming and easy even when travelling alone.  The hotel location is incredibly close to the airport which is super convenient, parking is charged at £8 per 24hr period for guests or there is a shuttle bus with a small fee to get to the terminals.   Beds are very comfortable with a choice of pillow softness. Good tea/coffee facilities. A range of lighting options to suit your preference. Bathrooms are compact but of good quality.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"As cabin crew I and many others use the Gatwick central travelodge almost as a second home.   To crew not booked or visited yet this year, you will NOT be allow to check in before 1500 not even 1 minute before. Plus don’t be surprised if you are banished to floor 1 or the annex which seems to be the policy for 2019!!  It seems gone are the days of us having the 5th floor where mostly we respected start and finished times, without the inconvenience of children running up and down the corridor, and excited holiday makers revalling until early dawn.

"Firstly, Travelodge are generally great. Fantastic value, clean room, comfy bed, polite staff. Normally I'd give 4 star. I had an issue. The only room heating option of a combination aircon/heater on the wall. These things are noisy, so I couldn't sleep with it on. I woke several times in the night cold. A wall mounted oil filled radiator would be a much better solution.  I'm tired at work today due to not having a good nights sleep. I wouldn't stay again during the colder months unfortunately.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"I checked in about 10:30pm but had made a reservation a few days before that. The check-in process was quite easy and efficient. I was so exhausted from a long day of traveling and really wanted to go get some sleep. The receptionist was friendly and professional. She gave me the key card in a matter of minutes and I was able to go to my room to sleep. The room and mattress were clean and comfortable. The bedsheets were clean and as well as the pillow. I was able to get ready for bed and go to sleep in less than a half an hour. The only issue was that the soap dispenser in the bathroom was broken, so it took a little effort to squeeze some soap out to wash my hands.

Booked family room  Check in was quick and staff pleasant.  Most importantly room clean.  - slept ok - curtains could do with being touch bigger - let in some light  Not travelodge’s fault - other guests have no respect - banging doors and talking loudly early hours passing room.  Bathroom - powerful shower and plentiful hot water.  £8 parking for 24 hours - find it bit cheeky when staying at hotels to have to pay for parking. ,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

Only complaint was soap dispenser in both shower and washbasin did not work told reception and they left a cup of liquid soap for us so was able to use that,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"All was very good, great value for the money! Two details: there were white stains on the surface around the lavatory in the bathroom, and one of the spoons in an apparently clean cup was used, i.e., dirty, which I did not realise in the first instance, that was really disgusting. But things like that can happen, apart from that, the hotel room and surrounding was clean, and I would stay there again (for this money).Just note that to get there back and forth from the airport you have to take a shuttle (2x3 pounds), around 10-15 minutes wait and a 5 minute tour or so.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Lovely welcome at reception. Helpful, friendly young lady, stored my case as I arrived in the morning so rooms weren't ready. I returned later and check in was smooth and pleasant, I was taken to the luggage room to collect my case and given directions to find my room. The room was large, warm, very clean and welcoming. Following the refurbishment, the colours are relaxing and the bed was so comfortable and the bathroom had power shower and a bath, lovely fluffy white towels.

Cleaned this up also managing to throw the half cup of coffee it prepared, over myself, so gave it up as a bad job and went to bed.

"All we needed was a bed for the night between flights.Generally we know the quality we are getting at a Travelodge - not extravagant, but has everything we need.  Price also reflects this.Walked to the hotel from a local bus stop and found that stretch in darkness.  Dressed in black pulling a dark suitcase along the road (no footpath) I felt a bit vulnerable.  Why no path or lights?","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

Best value airport room by miles. Same price as all the B&B around yet as it's just been renovated this outclasses them.

Katie who worked behind reception couldn't have been more helpful and without issue, managed to swap our bookings around so we could stay in the Gatwick hotel.  The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable and completely done the job. The bar is 24 hour which is always good and created a night vibrant atmosphere for a few drinks in the evening.

I used the self check-in kiosk but instead of getting a room key I was given a receipt and directed to a staff member at the front desk. It was quite a long winded and bizarre process, where about half a dozen receipts were collected and the staff member would disappear into the back office to cut the key cards.  I was given a room on the third floor, it was a family room as that was the only room type available when I booked at short notice.

I had a good sized room, which was clean, as I entered the room I found it rather cold so I tried to turn the heating up, but it wouldn't go above the temperature already allocated, so I decided to turn it off all together as it was just making the room colder. I wanted an early night as I had a early flight but the guests above my room where very noise (but eventually quieter down), I also got woken up a few times in the night because the air-con kept making noises, even though it was turned off.

Arrived for a preflight stay. On arriving we went to our room to find the floor damp and the room smelling musty. The shower was very small but useable. The bed had little hairs in it and blood stain on the sheets. We went down to reception and into the bar to get a drink but there was no one there to serve us so we retired to our room.  We went to get some food early as we wanted a early night and we were the first ones to the restaurant. It got busy very quick and was noticeable by the limited number of staff running around like headless chickens.

We stayed here the night before we flew. It’s good for that reason. You don’t stay here for things in the hotel so it’s a no thrills affordable hotel.  We got a king size bed and the room had lost of space. Room was clean and so was the bathroom.  The only negative was that the air conditioning unit kept us awake for the majority of the night.

"Having stayed here frequently in the last 6 months, my experience has varied from absolutely fine to awful. It depends on the room you are allocated, and who is on duty. Rooms on the first floor annexe are not good, and the most recent one I stayed in (on the 5th floor) was freezing cold with a very noisy heating fan that made little difference to the overall temperature.

"I stay at hotels in Crawley for business throughout the week and I have been to lots of hotels around the area.  Whilst I appreciate ‘you get what you pay for’ malarkey, I am still disappointed by Travelodge standards.   There are some good things about it: rooms are big, beds comfy and you can’t fault the staff as they are helpful and friendly.  However, I’ve stayed here for two weeks in a row now due to the last minute booking changing and whilst I appreciate the low cost, my second week has not been super joyful.   First of all, I check in to the room and after 4,5 hours journey and a full day of work I want to relax.

You can reach the hotel easily with shuttle service from Gatwick airport (both terminals) for £3 cash per ride. The room was quiet. Bed is comfortable and clean. If you’re traveling internationally they offer 4 USB slots to charge your devices. The heating is controlled so it’ll automatically set itself back to 15-20 degrees which was too chilly for me. I had to readjust hearing every 30 minutes. Other thing I’ve noticed is after I’ve returned from a business trip and hung the room service sign at the door, the room was cleaned returning 5 hours later but I received dirty towels (from someone else) I don’t know if they didn’t wash them correctly or if they just assumed someone’s towels","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

So my friend and I went to the bar super amped as we were going to vegas. We stayed in the hotel. It was good for the price we paid. Everything was accessible easily and the room was great.

"This hotel is a short distance from Gatwick, accessible by coach transfer (£3 per person) or taxi (£6 for 2 people going from the hotel to the North Terminal. It’s basic but clean with comfortable beds. Cafe on site appears reasonable value for pub style food or slip to the neighbouring hotel which has a more extensive, but reasonably priced menu.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"We decided to stop over the night before flying to Barcelona for cruise. We had previously stayed at this hotel and was very pleased with the condition and facilities at the hotel and, again, we were very pleased. The only negative comment we have is that there were a lot of workmen in the bar during the evening all still dressed in their work clothes hogging the bar which made it difficult to order meals and drinks. Otherwise a lovely stay again.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"I travelled from Bristol, South West to get to this hotel for an overnight stay before heading out for an adventure to Jordan. I was amazed by the shear size of this hotel. Not surprisingly on arrival there was a queue to book in. I was pleased that i reserved a room for the night before travelling because otherwise that would have been 4 hours on coach and then 5 hours on a plane, non-stop. This is a really nice hotel with a welcoming reception and certainly lots of space to chill/ relax. Good size bathroom/ en-suite.   I had a pizza for my evening meal which was made in-house - wasn't brilliant but it was ok considering I was just staying for the night. Got a good nights rest in before travelling.

She didn't know so poked her head out the door to ask the cleaner in the corridor what's the address. Cleaner replied ""No English, no understand"" the 999 operator told her to go to reception and pass the phone over so they could ask the receptionist what the address was and surprise surprise the receptionist refused the phone and said ""I don't understand english"" my friend started to shout for first aid and the guy behind the desk shrugged his shoulders","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

We travelled up on a Thursday evening after work and got caught up about halfway in the heavy traffic and road closures as a result of the heavy snow. What should have been a 3 1/2 hour journey took more than 8 hours, so we arrived at around 3 in the morning to be told the hotel was overbooked as we couldn't stay.  We were initially told we needed to drive to the other hotel we'd been moved to, but given the horrendous journey we'd just experienced my husband explained he wasn't happy getting back in the car (the roads were treacherous).

Cheap but room smelled awful. It looked clean enough but smelled overpoweringly of not just mildew but body odour. I was too tired to complain.

"The rooms are basic but fine, totally in line with the price paid.  The big issue for us was temperature control.  Despite an option to choose heat or cool, it was disabled centrally.  Heat was the only available option.  And, as the windows cannot be opened, you have to be someone who does not mind baking in a hot hotel room overnight.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Myself and a friend stayed here with our 2 toddlers the night before flying. The hotel itself was clean and tidy but considering we were staying with two young children we were put in a family room next door to a group of loud/drunken men. When said men went to sleep at around 11pm we thought we would finally be able to sleep. The children managed to sleep however my friend and I didn’t sleep at all. The hotel itself creaks and taps constantly plus there was a constant humming noise even though we turned our air conditioning/heating off.   The room was cheap and is close to the airport but I can honestly say I would prefer to pay more and stay elswhere in future.

"Stayed here 25th jan for one night and had a very bad night.Check in fine ,room clean,bar and food good.BUT the nights sleep didnt happen due to noise from road works across the road,car alarms from the compound in front of hotel going off and ignorant guest shouting as they left the lodge.These things are probably not the lodges fault but the worst noise was from the air conditioning unit which sounded like someone was either having a constant shower or pee all night.This is the companys fault and needs sorting.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

Booked a cot for our 18 month old (as travelodge stipulates) 2 days before but upon arrival, surprise surprise no sign and reception said they had been too busy and none now available. They said  some guests may have checked out now but seemingly couldn’t be bothered checking the rooms or log to find out which! First impressions look ok for the price you pay but we noticed hair in the bath and by the time our daughter eventually went to sleep and I climbed into bed...I felt a sharp point in my back, which turns out was an old toe or finger nail!

Shuttlebus to both terminals every few minutes at a very reasonable price.  Dined in the restaurant, the staff were charming and attentive.  Drinks selection was very good with a bottle of wine reasonably priced and very good.  The Beef Bourguignon was brilliant, the crumble with proper custard really hit the spot.

Our flight home arrived at midnight - too late to contemplate driving home so we had pre-booked this hotel. WE stayed there for a night at the beginning of our holiday too as we had an early flight. With Car Parking (chargeable but reasonable) it was so convenient. There is a bus which stops at the front door which runs every 15 mins during the day and every 30 mins at night going too/from both South and North Terminii and it costs a flat £3 per person each way - so convenient!. Be warned though at the NORTH terminal it is quite a covered walk from the bus stop to the actual terminal building. Back to Travelodge we had a very comfortable room complete with TV and tea/coffee with an endless supply of replenishments close to reception.

Clean, comfy enough beds and quiet , all before a long flight to USA, for what you pay its fine.

For the price, you can't really go wrong.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
The room was perfectly acceptable for one night before an early flight.  The problem was the restaurant. Was told by one member of staff there was a broken machine so only currys were available.

Thankfully a local takeaway came to our rescue.,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

It was very hard to park, so had to leave car on edge of parking spaces- some people left cars on the grass.  I learned a lesson here, we had an early flight, so with no sleep it ruined the first day of our break.

Then time passes and it’s 3:15pm, finally checked-in and went to the room. They didn’t give any direction to elevators or help us get there. Honestly this was the worst service I have actually had from hotel staff. Rude, snobby and downright disrespectful. This goes for the young black woman at the reception the following day, who literally said “I am too busy to pay attention to the bus schedule. I don’t have time for that”... so what is your job then??  3rd floor was disgusting. Smelly, noisy and ugly. The pictures are clearly deceiving.

All very satisfactory and a spacious double on 5th floor (quiet floor) facing car park. Other family guests who stayed too said the food in restaurant was mediocre and there was few staff serving in bar (doubled up as servers in restaurant we identified), which was frequently left unstaffed.

Only issue was a inconsiderate family next door who thought it was acceptable to let their small kids scream down the corridor and be noisy in the room next to us. When you have to get up at 4.45am for a flight this is not ideal and woke all of us up. I think as people are sleeping and waking up at slightly different times to a normal hotel it might be helpful to remind people of this!  Check in was really quick with a machine that does it all for you and gives your 'key'. There is also a receptionist too, but loved the idea of the 4 machines for speed.

I had very basic package - 30 mins free internet and breakfast not included (helpful as no time for all you can eat breakfast).  Helpful staff.  Card entry to stairs to bed rooms   Despite being close to north terminal no good path to walk there with cases.  No safe in room but there is a luggage room available.  Rubbish dumped in car park. Automatic check in wasn't working so there was a bit of a queue ,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"This is the second time I have stayed overnight before an early morning flight.  It is excellent value for money.  I have stayed at many Travelodge hotels over the UK so know the hotels are basic but clean, this one is the same.  There is a 24 hour bus service to and from the terminals for only £3 each way so again, good price compared to a taxi.  Highly recommended.

"For a preflight one night only, this hotel is good value. I have given 4 ratings because of the price we paid.. It’s basic, very close to the airport and  does the job!

You would never believe you were next to a major airport. Good value parking and just £3 each on the shuttle bus. A cracker of a hotel newly refurbished and updated  Good value for money  Good food at £12 a head for two decent sized potions . Didn’t noticed any beers other than lager .

"We were returning from a hectic two weeks in India and should have arrived at the hotel late afternoon. Unfortunately due to the military problems our flight could not pass over Pakistan. We were delayed for two hours and our 8.5 hour journey took nearly 14. On arrival at the hotel we were too late for our pre booked dinner. Rachel however managed to rustle us up a couple of pizzas and some fries along with two very much needed glasses of wine. Nothing was too much trouble for her, even though she was going off duty. This is what service is all about. Thank you Rachel from two weary travellers. You are a credit to your company.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"We pre-paid for parking and when we turned up there were no spaces. We informed the staff in the hotel who responded with ""Yeeeee, you will have to try and find a space on the grass somewhere"". Eventually found what I think was the last patch of grass as many other cars were still hunting for a spot after I had parked. Our air-con unit was also very noisy (plumbing related as the noise persisted when it was turned off). I will not be returning as I don't want to risk not having somewhere to park (and wasting money on parking) while away on holiday, and would like to be able to sleep at night.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"Like many staying here I had an early morning flight to catch and selected this hotel on the strength of the Travelodge brand, proximity to the airport and extremely competitive room price.  Although costing £3 for a very short ride, the official airport shuttle buses are reliable and operate on a 24/7 basis.  The check-in was prompt and friendly.  My room was pretty large - indeed since there was no furniture other than a compact desk and two small chairs this additional space was somewhat wasted.  The room did smell a bit of its previous occupant but was clean and the bed felt comfortable.  It was a bit chilly but no doubt I could have rectified that if I'd bothered to adjust the air conditioning. The bathroom was perfectly OK.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"We have stayed at this Travelodge on several occasions the night before our flights on holiday.  The rooms themselves are clean, tidy and comfortable plus are a good size for a night's stay.  Considering the hotels position close to the airport and the number of people coming and going at all times of the night, the rooms are surprisingly quiet.  One disappointment was that there are no glasses (plastic or otherwise) in the bathroom which we find very essential.  We ate in the café and the food was very good, large portions.  The café has been refurbished since we last stayed, we preferred how it was before as although it was a bit ""canteeny"" you could eat anywhere and there was more comfortable seating available.  We will stay here again in the future as it is very good value","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"Booked this hotel for an overnight stay to have relaxing evening before a long flight - first error! Very noisy during the night and an uncomfortable bed made for a very poor nights sleep.  Our room was very basic but suitable for our overnight stay. However the room didn’t appear to have been fully cleaned after the last guests departure. The bathroom had hairs in the sink, bath and toilet (luckily we had wipes with us!) Fortunately it was obvious that the bed had been changed as it was clean. The carpet was covered in bits and the room in general needed a good clean.   I wouldn’t recommend staying in this hotel.

This hotel was the worst. We wanted somewhere to stay before we flew out from gatwick. We booked in advance for a double room and when we got there they gave us the disabled room. Room was awful they had two single beds together they kept on sliding apart when we were asleep. The room was absolutely freezing. We tried to change the temperature on the thermostat but it kept on saying error. We told reception and they reset it but still it was only a little improvement. Also because we got the disabled room the shower was a floor shower so the water got everywhere in the bathroom. Worst experience ever do not go here. Even if it is cheap.

Room was 26/27 degrees for the entire stay. Hotel staff dismissed this saying it was impossible as entire hotel was set to 22. Thermostat in room showed otherwise and both myself and my partner were unable to sleep properly for 3 nights. I was told to prop the door open to get some air from corridor which struck me as both a security and privacy concern! Mould in the shower.

Bathroom was also clean and there was a bathtub. We stayed only one night but base on that this was a good experience and I believe that if we need a hotel near the airport in the future, we will choose this hotel again.  Bus goes from the hotel to the airport but we used taxi and it wasn't even expencive so if there are more than one traveller, taxi is a good option (pay cash).  We didn't use free wifi (first 30 mins, after that it costed something, I don't remember how much) so I don't know how it worked.

We arrived at around midnight after returning from our Egyptian holiday with our daughter, son-in-law and their 3 month old baby, in 2 cars, to find the large car park completely full, and cars parked on verges, and anywhere there was a potential space. We went to reception to be told that this is an ongoing problem as the car park is now leased out and people can pay to park and then use the shuttle bus that runs, even if they're not using the Travelodge. After complaining that we'd booked, had a small baby, and been travelling for 8 hrs, we were told we could park on double yellow lines outside the door as long as we didn't block","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

What could go wrong? Everything!! When I arrived late from Gatwick I needed something small to eat and was sent to the bar. The only thing they did was pizzaslices and panini. a posh Italian name for a microwaved monstrosity, in this case. It was absolutely disgusting and could not be recognised as something even close to food to be consumed. I then retreated to my room. As soon as I entered the long corridor of my floor, the fifth floor, my eye was caught by a tray full of crap. Plus then some.

When we showed the manager and staff there, they suggested we should tell our bank and there's nothing they want to do about it and was very rude in the way they said it. We was also told in a sarcastic way they won't do anything and that if we have a problem with that then call the police and then was given the emergency service number.

Be prepared to have change in pound coins for the parking machine outside – the one inside was broken – and it’s difficult to do in the dark with no lighting.

Usual Travelodge room, it does exactly what is required – we paid a great price, less than £30 – the bed was really comfortable and the shower was really good.

There`s a shuttle bus between the hotel and both terminals of the airport which is very cheap to use. Just cant fault this place and the Reception staff have always been a pleasure to deal with.

Car parking is extra but only £8 per day which is competative for airport parking. The Trvaleodge has been refurbished and it was very clean and we enjoyed a peaceful nights sleep. We had a family room which was warm, light and spacious. A useful tip is that t a taxi is the same price as 4 using the shuttle bus so that was great to pre book via the reception and jump the queue the night morning and travel direct to the South terminal.

"Lovely clean, spacious, airy, nice ambient lounge and dining area.   Nice spacious clean room with two chairs.   BUT, the most unhelpful staff, who look bored and seem to really not care.  And have no customer training.  Information on how the WiFi works is like pulling teeth.    ","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Despite prepaying for internet we failed to connect except for the free 30 mins. The heating which is under some form of central control persistently turned itself off after a few minutes , it was cold. There is no heating in the bathroom. This was a super room!","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

I had to thinker with the Ariel slightly to get the TV to work but other than that a very good nights sleep was had and my connection via shuttle bus to the airport was easy and stress free.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
Stayed here for flight to Finland next day .  Room lovely clean  Had dinner in cafe ( half chicken) excellent.  All staff really polite and helpful. Good service all round.  Highly recommend.  Got £3.00 shuttle bus from airport every 15 mins .,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Use travelodge regularly as we know that we will have a good clean room, bathroom, towels and bedding. The beds are always comfortable as are the pillows. TV reception is good and not a bad size tv. Room also had an iron and ironing board but no hair dryer. I didn't need one but I would think they would be available at the reception. The only disappointment was the breakfast. We were apologised that there were no eggs!! Found that very strange, but the hot buffet was just to say warm. We would still return to this travelodge as the proximity to the airport is brilliant, especially the price. Also a shuttle bus stops outside the hotel and only charges £3.00 per adult. I know it was less for children but do not know how much","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"We booked a family room as somewhere to grab a few house sleep before flying back home to Spain early the following day.  We’ve booked travel lodge before, they’re basic but clean.  Internet should be provided a premier inn give free internet not just half an hour.  No iron and ironing boards any more just a dirty room with the ironing board set up to be used by everyone.  I much prefer premier inn for a budget hotel. ","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"I stayed here for one night on a Sunday before flying to the US on Monday. Very nice room, large, clean & good bathroom.

An amazing price and I would def stay here again next time I fly from Gatwick.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"This is a big Travel Lodge and probably new smaller rooms and en-suites but were clean and comfortable so no complaints. They have the 24 hr bar and food service and evening meal was excellent and really good service too. Only one grumble! Got down to breakfast halfway through the service to be told there were NO eggs and NO fruit salad! How can this be?? Gatwick Airport, London and no eggs! Have Hens stopped laying? Poor planning by someone maybe? Eggs is all I wanted so unlucky for me so had to go elsewhere for breakfast. This was March 18 if anyone knows why I would love to know!","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

Have stayed at this hotel several times and received positive service. Today however on checking the receptionist was rude and unable to assist with basic information request. When asked for directions to our room she was totally non responsive. As we walked away she shouted we were rude in fact if she classes people who have English as a second language as rude it’s obvious the educational system let her down. when the duty manager was requested to take our feed back on customer service he became extremely defensive and treated we as paying guest with distaste. So disappointed that these two individuals are letting down what was and has been a well run low cost service provider.

"Stayed at this hotel the night before my flight. It is convenient to the airport, there is a $3 bus to and from. When I first arrived at 2:30,they said I could not check in until 3. Not really a problem so I headed to their restaurant where I waited over 20 minutes and nobody was around to order a drink.  Shortly after 3 I was able to check in. The room was fairly clean, bed was comfortable but bathroom was the size of an outhouse, super small, the whole bathroom is one unit like a shower stall is. Very odd and tiny. No soap in my dispensers either. And the worst part they charge $3 pound to connect to wifi which I just found odd. If you really need that extra $3 add it in the price of the hotel.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"This was a truly excellent stay. All the staff were fabulous, when they offered me my room they asked me if it was alright, giving me the option to change if I wasn't satisfied. But where the experience really shone was when I went to the bar. There was a talented musician who just happened to be there that night and Jamie, the bartender, turned down the music so hthe musician could entertain the troops. Jamie was very engaging, a great listener, and extremely attentive to everyone's needs. At reception, Salvatore was ready to drop what he was doing to assist me, as well. The Assistant Manager, Ben, was very helpful as well. Thanks to the whole team, while the room was great, it's the people who work here who really made my stay!

"A very comprehensive refurbishment has resulted in a bright and airy hotel, very well positioned in easy reach of the Gatwick airport terminals. On my previous stay it was depressing 'never to return' but the transformation deserves congratulations and this time I found the room very acceptable with a comfortable bed and well fitted bathroom. The reception area is big and, behind it, the bar has lots of armchairs in a spacious layout. I didn't have a meal but the dining area beyond the bar looked businesslike. I will certainly use it again when flying from/to Gatwick.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Less than 10 minutes by frequent shuttle to the airport. £6 return.   The location is convenient, the hotel will neither surprise nor delight.   A long queue to checkin as the Self Service machines were all out of action. Staff not especially friendly but efficient.   Room was standard Travelodge. Smelt a odd (mould? but no visible evidence). Wifi signal poor.   Mattress excellent and overall a decent night's sleep. ","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
Great for stopping for a night before an early flight. Room is excellent. Staff are great. But food is appalling bad.  Prompted waiter 3 times asking where the dessert was. Empty assurances because after an hour I gave up and finally walked out even though I had paid for it. It’s not busy. ,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"We stayed here the night before flying out. It's very handy for Gatwick airport and the room was a good size. At first glance all was good until we went into the bathroom. The shower curtain was really badly creased, like someone had slept on it , but the worse thing was the cleanliness. There were pubic hairs all over the floor and all sorts of dirt and grime in the corners. Yuk!! It really was quite disgusting. I had a word with the receptionist and she said she'd pass it on to the cleaners. Let's hope she did.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Never used a Travel Lodge before and choose the basic room which was OK, but a hair dryer would have been nice. Decided to have BF before setting off home and advert card looked nice. Asked for a quiet room and was, a nice comfy bed and pillows. Spacious and limited hanging space but it was only for l night, good lighting and air con. Bathroom adequate, a handle in the shower but no bathmat. BF next morning l was disappointed to find no fresh fruit salad as advertised supposed to be freshly made. Only a bowl of oranges. When l asked about the salad, told 'non left from yesterday! Is it only made once a week, this was Tuesday. Also no hot plates and some of the hot food did not look that inviting. I would stay again, but forget BF.  Courtesy bus was good.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Compared to other hotels in the area this offers very good value for money.  It has obviously had a recent makeover as everywhere looked fresh and clean.  Family room was very spacious with bath and shower.  Breakfast in the café bar was self-service with plenty of hot and cold choices.  Parking was £8 for 24hrs which was very reasonable and much cheaper than other hotels in the area.  I didn't need to use the shuttle bus to the airport, but noticed it was very frequent around every 10-15 mins.  Would recommend for business or people flying from Gatwick.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"After a very long walk from the airport a drink was much needed.

When when the conditioner is off it still makes this sound.  The windows also don’t block the sound out so a constant roar from outsize.  If you need sleep I do not recommend staying here. The walls are very thin and you can hear every door on your floor bang and hear TVs and people talking in other rooms. So if you want a good nights sleep. Forget it.

"Have stayed in this hotel a few times, prior to flying out the country or on return. This time the room we stayed in had been refurbished and was lovely. Was taken away from the typical travel lodge colours and the room we had was grey and pastels - lovely decor.  Plenty of hot water and everything was clean. As with any airport hotel there are people  walking about all times of the day and night but I feel people were considerate of early timings and were quiet.

"Have stayed a number of times at Travelodge but this was by far the noisiest. We had the misfortune to be in room 50, which is right next to the firedoor leading to the upstairs bedrooms. Given the nature of this hotel., the firedoor was banging all night long with people coming and going. The result was little sleep for us. Should you need  to stay overnight find another place to stay or, at the ver least, make sure you get a room which is wee away fro the firedoors","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"What a strange place! It’s the first time I’ve stayed in an airport venue, perhaps they are all the same? I don’t know. It was definitely a different experience to my usual travelodge trips.   The room itself was fine. It was a bed to sleep in.   The communal areas were really dirty, the 24hr bar was vast but every table was filthy. It just gave the air of being totally uncared for. Bar service was poor and very slow.   The shuttle service to Gatwick was late, despite there being a timetable on reception. Not travelodge’s fault I accept, but then hitting roadworks contributed to us missing our flight.   I very much doubt I would stay here again, I’d prefer to travel in and get up super early. At least I’d be in control of arriving on time ! ","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"I would recommend travelodge Gatwick airport as it’s close and easily accessible from Gatwick. However the bed was extremely uncomfortable, the plugs and light fightings didn’t function properly and there was a constant noise which sounded like a boiler heating up warm water coming from above. The breakfast and dinner was a little overpriced for the quality of food served. This stay would be okay you have an early morning flight to catch and need to get some zzs the night before, shuttle buses to and from the airport run 24 hours a day and will only take 10mins to get to south/‘north terminal.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

We listened and heard someone in there, so my partner returned to reception, and they apologised and said they written the wrong number on our card. The room was comfortable and clean. We went to the bar and cafe. The pizzas and burgers are very nice, but most of the other food on offer is disappointing as is obviously a microwave meal. Drinks are expensive.

"Travelodge isn't normally my first choice of hotel brand, but given that this hotel was advertised as having undergone a million pound makeover, and the price for the room was in line with other hotels, I thought I would give this hotel a try.  We arrived during the evening - the hotel is very dark out the front and I had to watch my footing owing to uneven surfaces with very little light.  The smokers were congregated outside the front door, meaning that I had to walk through a cloud of thick cigarette smoke to enter the hotel.  The reception is very large - almost like a conference centre - with a main reception desk and self check-in kiosks available.  We used the self check-in as there was a queue at reception.

"Hotel is great value, good quality 'everyday' rooms, clean and representative of what one may come to expect at a 'value' hotel chain. Bar was very expensive given the basic ambience, untrained bar-staff and the less than average welcoming into something of a closed market; and tantamount to exploiting the captive audience that are the customers -  who are less likely to seek alternative pubs nearby. Transfers to the airport were on time and cheap.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

We asked for a room at the end of the hall, one to let the kids burn off some energy and 2 to because it’s quieter and 3 because the view is amazing! Our room was spacious, comfortable and clean. After putting all our bags into the room, we headed down to the Bar Café. Rachel & Koye were lovely and served is swiftly at the bar and our meal was delicious!

To start the corridor and our room smelth very badly of damp, BO, old socks? Whatever it was it was very poor and off putting.  The hotel is looking tied and unloved and although fairly cheap, you have to ask would it be better to pay a little extra for something which is a bit more up market.

We ate in the restaurant which was fine, and went up to bed at 1030. I'd opted to sleep in the put up bed but when I pulled back the covers the sheets were stained and there were a couple of hairs and crumbs. I considered just manning up as I was tired but pulled back the sheets on the second bed only to find there were black ink-type stains. I really couldn't sleep in dirty sheets so went to reception. We then had to pack up all our stuff and move to a better room and eventually got into bed around 1115 to get up at 530.

We ate in the restaurant which was good value and also very well run. Next morning there was a good choice of hot and cold food. We left the car in the car park for the duration of our trip which was also good value.  The bus picked us up outside the door and dropped us off at the South Terminal.

We arrived to the airport and then whilst we were inside we realised that our son had left his backpack inside the taxi. I contacted the hotel to see if there was any chance to track the taxi and after some days, they got back to me telling me that they were able to find the taxi and get the backpack. However, by that time I was already in Italy but the staff at the hotel helped me to pack the backpack and then I make","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"Stayed here for one night before an early flight. Very good price for the room, even though the parking made it a 3rd more expensive. The check in was abrupt and curt. The staff were busy chatting to each other, paused briefly to check me in (hand me a door card and ask no further questions???) And then went straight back to their conversation before I'd walked away. The room: decent size room. Hairs over bottom sheet, very very dusty spare pillows on the shelf. Poor water pressure in bathroom. Limescale in kettle. A stained mug. Never expect the Ritz due to the price paid, but cleanliness and politeness should come as standard whatever you're paying. I normally rate Travelodge, but this was a rather flat experience.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Myself, my partner and a friend booked 2 rooms here for a 2 night stay. Unfortunately we had an awful visit. Starting at the airport we had to pay £3 each for a transfer bus to the hotel, when we arrived got told a taxi is only £6. The extortionate prices didn’t stop there with their vending machines. We decided not to eat in the restaurant after overhearing another customer complaining about the poor food quality. Had to change rooms due to stained sheets!!! Went for breakfast at £8.95 all you can eat... no fried eggs for a full English only scrambled made from powdered egg. The list grew throughout our stay, too many things for this review but enough to email the General Manager... over a week later and still no reply!!

"My wife and I stay at Travelodge often for 3 reasons. A comfortable bed, value for money and cleanliness. Unfortunately while we got the first 2, the room was not clean to even a reasonable standard. The shelves had not been wiped as they had water rings from where glasses had been and there was an empty plastic bottle on the floor.

I stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of April 2019. When I returned to my room after spending the day on the coast I found that all the belongings in my room had been removed by the cleaners. This constituted several items of clothing a very expensive toilet bag and some food and drinks. I reported it to the front desk and they went through the motions of investigating it.  I reported it th he next morning to the new duty manager and she assured me it would be investigating ed d and ty hey would call me before my flight. Nothing!!!

Took 3 attempts to get a room then they forgot to write the room number on card so didn’t know where to go. There were no glasses in room so asked at reception, no problem they said....ask at bar. The barman virtually suggested I might abscond with them....What a way to deal with a customer. We eventually went for dinner at 7pm, chose off the menu, total rubbish turned up, pastry like leather, peas like bullets and burnt chicken. They changed the order and was a lot better.

There was a terrible scraping noise above our room so had to call reception and assume they spoke to the occupants because the noise stopped shortly afterwards. Very disappointed when there was no light/continental breakfast option as we don’t eat cooked breakfast so had to eat later at the airport.

The reception area somewhat resembles an airport check in, with efficient and helpful staff. The room was clean and the bathroom facilities were better than I expected. There was a large bar/ restaurant with very attentive staff keen to sell two of everything as it was “happy hour” the seating was comfortable and there were plenty of chairs. The restaurant was very much like a motorway service station, but everything was very clean. The food came exceptionally quickly, I don’t know if it was microwaved but it was fine.

The control panel in the room is just for show, when you try to switch on the AC it’ll just tell you it’s centrally controlled.

There are no signs leading up to it. Turn left of the roundabout and you will come across it. In the dark with no signs !!! COME ON Travelodge if your competitors all have brown signs saying how to find them why not you? The actual hotel was clean and tidy and if needed i would use it again now knowing how to find it.,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"WE stayed twice within the space of a week: once on departure and once on return. On both occasions the service and facilities were all that we expected and needed. On our first trip we were alarmed to learn that breakfast was going to cost us £9.50 or so each. Being reluctant to pay that some of money for a bowl of fruit, a pot of yoghurt, a small packet of cereal and a cup of coffee we turned to leave the restaurant resolving that we would fast until we reached the airport some four or five hours later. However, Jessica (?) provided a solution and we both enjoyed our little morning meal. The coffee was good too. On leaving after our return trip we found ourselves without money for the busfare to the airport. Emma(?) learning of our dilemma ordered a taxi for us which allowed","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"There was no parking spaces left, we were advised to park at the airport by the receptionist. The room was clean but the bed really uncomfortable. The room was so noisy, we could hear everything from the room next door, a young couple very much in love! The bathroom noises......mmmmm, and every other guest going to bed throughout the night.  I would pay more and stay somewhere else if I were you. Oh yes we found a space to park on a grass verge on the entrance to the hotel!","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
Whilst the hotel was good the parking was chaotic with cars parked on the grass areas (fortunately dry) as there were so many vehicles there - many more than the number of rooms in the Travelodge. Charging at £8 for a 24 hour period with a maximum stay of 15 days seems to be the reason as many vehicles were probably left while their owners went away!  The ticket machines were out of order and one had to pay over the phone with an automated system and then send a text message with registration details etc! - OK if you have signal.   The hotel is very close to the airport but fortunately there was little noise from the aircraft taking off or landing. An issue was that there were no glasses in the room - necessitating a trip to the bar to obtain.,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

This is an awful Travelodge. The rooms are as expected but the leisure/communal areas are horrible. Don't expect any comfort in the bar which is over priced and like a community hall/sports centre.

Only issue was that I had prebooked car parking but this wasn't showing on my booking - had to show my email to prove I had prepaid for it. The rooms aren't very soundproof and be prepared to hear doors banging etc for people assumingly getting up/in for flights etc. ","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
We stayed in a Travelodge plus room and although they are a step up in normal rooms they still could be made better. Curtains still let in a lot of light and is very easily rectified by putting up a pelmit on top to block the light that comes in.  Air in is a nice addition but you can’t change the settings from heating to aircon it Also a very noisy unit even when it’s not turned on it still makes a funny noise that can’t be stopped.  Showers are an improvement with moveable shower heads rather than fixedones coffee machine is a great extra with free KitKat’s :).,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

Pulled back the blanket and to my horror there was blood on the mattress. This was visible through the sheet. The wife went to be sick in the toilet and to her horror, there was two separate areas on the bathroom door which has blood stains. Luckily there were also two single beds in the room which were clean. Too tired to complain  at that point we just fell asleep in the single beds.

"- No direct walking path from the airport and no instruction on how to get to the hotel. We followed a walk path which led to the wrong place. We (2 girls) ended up lost, in the middle of nowhere at 1am, with heavy suitcases, 5°C weather and no cab around. We had no other choice than ask to a stranger for a ride which is very unsafe! - At the hotel, DAB did not work. Reception told us we need to get a shuttle to to the airport which cost 3£ and had to pay cash only. Receptionist could not get any cash back. closest DAB cost 1.95£ to get money for a 3£ shuttle.

"Only a quick stay after a late evening flight. My only complaint is that the information on Travelodge's website for the bus transfer from Gatwick South Terminal is wrong. It says to get a G1, G3, or G7 bus from stand 8 - this is wrong, it should be stand 9. This may sound like a trivial detail, but I was waiting late at night at stand 8 for a bus when a G3 bus pulled into stand 9. By the time I scurried halfway to stand 9 the bus pulled away as no one was actually stood at stand 9. This left me waiting another 20 minutes as a lone female traveller after midnight. TRAVELODGE: Please update your website with the correct bus stand information. That aside, the hotel is convenient and we'll presented, clean and had a very comfortable bed.

The food arrived within about ten minutes as the place was very quiet. Everything tasted delicious unlike my last visit. It's also had a very nice looking refurbishment. The room was tidy and spacious, very basic but had enough for my requirements. Take your own shower gel tho as the one in the room smells vile!

Ironing facilities and hair dryer can be requested from reception, there’s no phone in the room so you need pop down every time you need something.

"Decent , me and my misses stayed here for some hours. We was greated very well. We booked a taxi for 6 punds instead of taking the bus to the terminal for 3 punds each. Very clever at the desk. The room it self was ok . It have USB input so that was good because we forgot the extension. ","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

Head waiter failed to tell us we needed to order food at the bar and we did not spot this on the menu..","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"Late return flight, landed, plus usual conditions through airport so was happy to get to hotel quickly, took a time to find bus stop to hotel, bus soon arrived and not too far to hotel. On arrival it was an easy check in, small room for three people, Clean and tidy. Check in from 3pm to 12 noon next day, I arrived after midnight, had to then check out by midday, different booking system for a later check out would have helped.

"Stayed overnight here as it was cheaper than a night in Brighton - really good value for money. My room was on the ground floor right beside the door leading to all the rooms, so I thought it would be noisy, but it wasn't. Everywhere was well maintained and clean. I don't like shower curtains, but at least it was clean and did fit inside the shower tray to prevent flooding the room. Bathroom is small ""pod"", but fine for an overnight stay. Bus from/to Gatwick airport is £3 a trip and only accepts cash.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

Good amenities.  Parking an issue as £8 for 24 hrs with no option for a smaller rate period.  All other Travelodge we have stayed in parking is free.

"Had 2 night stay here, B & B. Breakfast is excellent, such a variety hot and cold, plenty to eat and drink. We had 2 evening meals here as well, which was also good, again very good portions and tasty. Only drawback was the length of time to order meals, but once ordered they came very quickly and hot. The rooms were as expected clean and basic.  Only drawback was that we couldn’t control the heating. If we had asked reception I’m sure they would have done it for us.  Reception staff were quite pleasant and friendly.  Had to pat £3 per day for WiFi, I’m sure in this day and age they could throw this facility in with room rate.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
We booked a super room and we weren't disappointed. Really spacious as it was on a corner. Comfortable bed and pillows. Room very clean We pre booked our evening meal which was very nice.

Stay last week at the lodge and had a great time. Room was a little budge but all around went too bad.

The English breakfast was very good, and I can't fault the food.  I would just say that they could have done with at least one more member of staff in order to keep tables cleared and food replaced quickly.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"We were looking for an overnight room before an onward trip. There were check-in kiosks meaning no wait to get out room key-cards. Elevators were easily accessible although stairs were not signposted from the lobby.  We had a family room and it was spacious and the bathroom facicites were clean, with wall mounted soap/shower wash. The beds were very comfortable with extra pillows on hand.  Vending machines were available in the lobby,  not over-priced, and contactless payment can be used, there was also a bar/restaurant available which we didn't use as we were arriving late and leaving early.  The room was warm when we arrived and the a/c took a while to cool it down to a sleeping temperature, but it was silent and our cool preferences are not to everyones choice.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
The Travelodge was very convenient to the airport.  there is a shuttle that cost 3pounds per person.  There is a 24 hour bar and restaurant. The room was well appointed.

"Quite a poor Travelodge overall. Don’t book here if you really rely on a good sleep.   Reception queues 10 deep, self service out of order (again).  Car park is too small for guest numbers so if you arrive after 6ish you’ll need to park at the airport! And then pay £3 to get to your car and back each time.   Room noise is appalling. Walls paper thin and you can hear when people talk, shout and use the toilet. I don’t blame them as they’re in their rooms and should be able to hold conversations but beware. Others will be able to hear you.   Our TV did not work.  The room temperature CANNOT be controlled by the guest.

"It’s not located walking distance to the airport, there is a bus to the terminal.  Parking is £8 per 24hours. There is no other rate.The car park was practically full too.   Check in was poor. Long queue and no receptionist on arrival.   The self check in terminals did not work.   Had room 535, spacious and minimalist.   But major problems over night with noise- from the road, people taking, creaking walls contracting and doors closing.   Very poor noise insulation.   Bathroom- basic- wall attached shower gel.   Did not try breakfast!    ","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"Positives: *Good size room *Price  was really reasonable (about £45) *Tea/coffee facilities *Good size bar/cafe with enough choices and they clingfilmed it so we could take it to our room because our toddler needed to go to bed!  Negatives: -There was a big gap down the side of the curtains, which meant light was shining on to what was the child's bed.  She therefore would not sleep until we moved the travel cot to a dark corner by the front door!  I would expect proper, well-fitted blackout blinds, given most people use a hotel the night before a flight because the flight is super early (we were needing to be up at 3.15am!). -as with any hotel, you get slamming doors and people chatting full volume all through the night, but not Travelodge's fault - just ignorant people!!

"After a flight delay of 3 1/2 hours, I arrived at the hotel at 6.30 am rather than the planned 3 am.   The receptionist, Reece, was very sympathetic, checked me in quickly so that I could get straight to my room and my bed and arranged late check out for no extra cost as he was so empathetic to my flight delay and how I was feeling - very tired and travel weary.    I was allocated a very comfortable room, with no noise and had a lovely sleep, on waking a refreshing cup of tea, followed by a soak in a deep warm bath, before getting ready for my onward journey.   Perfect. ","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Very basic hotel. Clean but limited. 30 mins free wifi and very expensive shuttle (4 GBP per person for trip) for less than a mile (in addition to long wait times). For two  or four people, it makes the hotel more expensive than the on-airport Premier Inn. IF you're by car and need a no frills place to sleep. This is probably fine.

"Excellent customer service.  Good value for money.  Very clean room, comfy bed.  There’s a place to leave luggage if the room isn’t ready.  Great shuttle service every 15 mins to both terminals.  Dining room excellent for breakfast but not much of a menu for dinner and expensive for what you get. ","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"On first impression the hotel looked as you’d expect from Travelodge, however it was a different story once I got to my room.  First of all the heat in the room was unbearable, despite offering ‘air conditioning’ this is controlled by reception presumably to save money. Despite my asking for it to be switched to cool, this never happened and to top it off it was turned to heat at night when it was already 25 degrees.  In addition there was a stench of raw sewage in the bathroom from the drains and the room smelt like it had been used to store dirty laundry.  Add torn and dirty sheets, drinks stains on the walls and WiFi that doesn’t work and you’ve pretty much got the impression.  I don’t expect a lot from a Travelodge but this place is probably the worst I’ve ever stayed in.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Great stay ahead of our flight from Gatwick. We checked in around 10pm which was quick and also got food which came quickly and was good. Checked out round 3pm with no problems.

I had the misfortune to stay in the Gatwick Central Travelodge on 31 May.    There is no problem with the rooms and they have all been refurbished and decorated. There were two people serving behind bar and there was always a queue of up to ten people in each queue ordering food and drinks. I ordered a bottle of wine which was Italian and cost over £18 which was dreadful.   Yes I know it’s London prices but you can buy a bottle of quality wine at Gatwick Premier Inn for less than £11!   I asked for three glasses and was told that they didn’t have any wine glasses!     This was because there were dozens of all types of glasses on tables along with plates!    I was given three different glasses which were not wine glasses and they were filthy!   I eventually managed to get glasses,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

She also charged me more than I booked my room for. Next morning I asked the manager why I paid twice, he apologized for her mistake, he said she shouldn't charged me second time but if I call them they will give my money back. I called them, they sent me to customer service. Customer service sent me back to the hotel. I called them couple of times, the answer is always the same: I take your number and someone will give you a call back. I haven't had a call back yet.

"155 Euros and 90 USD were stolen out of room number 170 during my stay in May 2019. Since there is no room safe I kept my passport folder incl. driving licence and  the foreign currencies in my bag. When leaving the room on the first day I asked housekeeping to clean the room which he did. Second day I asked another housekeeper to clean the room which she did. I know it is almost impossible to proof who stole the money unless fingerprints or DNA samples are taken. Since I keep accurate note on a small paper of all the foreign currencies I carry with me and the Travelodge was the only place the where passport folder was unattended  it is very, very likely that the cash got stolen out of the room. Very bad experience.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Although the hotel was clean, it is not that easy to get from the airport to the hotel - you need a shuttle bus and reliant staff in the airport who know one exists!.  In addition, there was no phone in the room so calling reception is not an option - difficult with a 6 year old who is sleeping.

"The Hotel was great, the staff were great, the room and breakfast were excellent. But it was all let down by the parking which was a joke and the wifi service of paying after 30 minutes is 5 years out of date.

The level of equipment and space were quite an improvement on the standard rooms, especially the coffee machine.

"For me it's convenient for Gatwick airport and the price is competitive.  The room is quite big compared to usual B&B's or Guest Houses.  The power shower is really nice and the lighting in the bathroom is good.  The bedding, pillows, towels are fresh and clean.  The room smells fresh and clean.  It is served by a local airport bus every 10-15 minutes for £3 one way (cash only) which is convenient.  Overall I was satisfied with everything and will probably stay here again next time I fly out of Gatwick, and I do recommend it to everyone.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Stayed at the Travelodge for two nights in a Super Room. The room was very spacious, clean and well appointed. The service from the staff that we encountered was excellent and the cafe/lounge area was modern and comfortable. If you are flying in/out of Gatwick, I would certainly recommend using  the shuttle service for 3 pounds p/person as the Travelodge is usually the second stop on the run so it doesn't take long to get to the hotel at all. The lounge area of the hotel is really comfortable, quiet, there are ample power outlets around and the food is great so my advice would be to hang around the hotel lounge to wait for your flight rather than use the airport lounges. Would definately stay here again.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"We booked a Super room for a one night stay prior to flying out of Gatwick.  Traveling with 2 boys (11 & 13) it was great that the room had 2 single beds rather than the usual sharing of a sofa bed, which generally leads to not much sleep. A nice touch of a coffee machine in the room, unfortunately only enough milk etc, for one drink each.  My only other gripe is that there were no toiletries in the room other than the soap dispenser in the bathroom.  Room very clean and comfortable bed, and no rooms heard through the walls/door from other guests.  Car Parking was £8.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

Very impressed with this Hotel and its location to Gatwick Airport is really the selling point. One of the more modern Travelodge hotels I've stayed in and I've stayed in quite a few over the years the dining/bar area is the best I've experienced. Rooms were presented nicely and staff were very helpful so  all in all an enjoyable family stay over. But can you please get the kitchen staff to cook the hash browns properly they're supposed to be golden and quite crucchy on thd outside and hit and fluffy in the middle. Your efforts are always anaemic and basically undercooked with out fail no matter where I stay in the UK if you're going to use frozen food please at least cook it well and not serve it like something off Rate my plate.  Great hotel nonetheless.  Paul Weston Nottingham,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

The bar offers a good selection of drinks and if you get there on happy hour you will find amazing deals !!  But the food was awful !! Although it was cheap... if you can find somewhere else for dinner don’t hesitate and go outside!! Even the burger was pretty awful.

Please note if more than one of you get a taxi as works out to be same price and quicker ask at reception for the booking.

"We stayed here overnight for both our outbound and inbound flights.  The rooms were very pleasant, good size, reasonable view, and very clean.  I do however like a window open when I’m sleeping but the windows are annoyingly locked shut, apparently to retain a constant temperature in the hotel. When you come in to the room for the first time the air conditioning is on. This was fine on our first night but our second stay the temperature outside was 11 degrees and the room was quite literally freezing cold. Not nice when you’ve just returned from southern Spain.  We had a meal in the restaurant on the night of our first stay. Some good vegan options, and reasonably good quality, better than expected.

Good job I spotted you had to pay to park as reception hadn’t mentioned it when I checked in. £8 is a bit steep though.  Room was clean tidy so no problem there.  Didn’t have breakfast but have dinner. £20 for a ready meal, bowl of chips and a pint of Diet Coke is very expensive. Think I’d eat elsewhere if I stay again.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

Arrived in the early hours following a late night flight back from Rhodes. Pre booked parking £8 and was relieved to see a few car spaces still available. It’s a pay and display car park. 2 machines to get a ticket are at the entrance of the Travelodge. There was no one at reception so I went through into the bar to ask for someone to check us in. There are several self service check in machines but I didn’t see them. We were given a family room on the 1st floor. The first thing we noticed that there was a horrible smell. Other than that it was clean with the extra beds made up.

"we had a lovely relaxed evening/night in the Travelodge Gatwick Airport before our early morning flight & with a 24 hour shuttle to both terminals, I did look at other hotels that were closer to the terminal but they were very expensive for 1 night, the travelodge was great value for money & was clean & comfortable I will book this hotel again.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Why bother reviewing a Travelodge, they are all the same aren’t they? Well, I hope not. This one charges for wifi (I thought that irritation had stopped years ago), which then didn’t work for the second device. The bar had no beer so I eventually got almost a full pint of Guinness from the hard-pressed staff. A dismally small choice of just four pizza toppings was followed by a very long wait. The room (56) had poor sound-proofing. The breakfast room was uncomfortably cold because of air-conditioning setting. The good cooking and friendly service was not enough to make up for a poor customer experience.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

When I first arrived I thought this was going to a great hotel  Food was acceptable and room looked good for the price   However once it was time to sleep I noticed the bed was extremely uncomfortable and the bed was hard around the edges this discomfort made sleep problematic  However at around 3ish I managed to get some sleep only to he awoken by a fire alarm at 3:30 due to other guests smoking in their rooms   This is not what I needed as I needed a good nights sleep before my long haul flight the next day  I will not stop at this hotel again,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

I didn’t want to do the hotel restaurant so I inquired with the assistant general manager, Ben for best Indian food and he said Taj Balti (it’s more of a Takeaway place but they do have 6 to 8 tables inside. Bring your own wine or beer since they don’t have it or serve it but allow you to bring it in.)  Hotel Exceeded my expectations as I was comparing it to travel lodges in the United States. Check in was perhaps the fastest I’ve ever experienced in my entire life. It was something like 90 seconds.

This location is served via a shuttle bus that runs 24 hours with buses running to a timetable that is avaliable from reception, the cost to either the South or North terminal is 4 GBP paid in ""cash only"" to the driver. The bus routes takes you to the south terminal first with a run time of approx 12 minutes and to the north terminal second with a further 8 or so minutes so allow 20 minutes to the North terminal from the hotel.

"If we want to fly from London Gatwick then we need to travel up from Devon the day before to ensure we are checking in at 0600 hours.  We have used the Gatwick Central Travelodge in many occasions.  The attraction is that guests can arrive and leave at all times of the day and there’s no need to pay for breakfast if you are heading for one of the many food outlets in the terminal.  The room is always the same, comfortable bed, bathroom, somewhere to hang your clothes and plenty of room to put your suitcases as you finalise your packing for the long journey.

"I’ve stayed here for quite a few weeks this year (working at Gatwick Airport) and its never been a hotel I’ve looked forward to staying in but it’s cheap. It’s cheap and relatively close to the airport but it’s what I call “a bit sticky”. The rooms are a good size but are very basic and the carpets are not always very clean often with a strong smell of something, to mask something worse maybe. The air con/heating in some rooms Worksop some rooms but in others it doesn’t (and the reception staff tell you that it’s “not user adjustable” despite the fact that some rooms are  user adjustable).

"I stayed at the travelodge after coming in on a late flight to Gatwick. The room was great value for money, spacious, comfortable and bright. Check in at reception took a long time which is why I'm not rating it five stars. I would use this hotel again though if I was ever planning on staying close to the airport. Shuttle bus service okay although service should be free of charge or added to the booking. Not everyone has cash on them. But overall great stay.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

My room didn’t have any bath wash and the AC didn’t work. I asked twice for help and the front desk person refused to do anything until 11pm. Apparently they don’t allow you to use the AC until you wait in line for 20 minutes at the front desk to get help. There literally are 2 people there that will do anything while there are at least 3 people at the bar.   I tried calling the front desk and the phone didn’t actually ring when I was standing in the lobby. So they just have a fake number to call them. ,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"We stayed on 3 different days, one night each time in June and July. Each room was comfortable, I like the nice big towels.

On our way to Cape Verde from Gatwick Airport we needed a bed before catching early flights to Sal and again on our return with a late flight arrival.

"I have stay in many different travelodge both for work and leisure. Gatwick is by far the worst.  It took us 10mins to find the room as the direction is wrongly giving. We have big suitcase and baby pushchair, somehow we have been giving a room on the first floor without lifts.... what a joke. The bathroom is blocked and the carpet is dirty.  P.S. it will cost £4 per person to get a 5mins coach ride to the hotel, what a rip off. ","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"Last weekend we stayed in a '5 star' hotel in Dublin while seeing a show.  I picked this hotel with the aim of making the weekend special.  The room was over the twice the cost per night as my overnight stay tonight in this Travelodge, and was room only.   The difference is like chalk and cheese ....and not as you expect either !  Well done Travelodge for a lovely, clean fresh room,  so much better stocked than our 'luxury' hotel room AND lovely and cool after baking last weekend and with friendly, obliging staff, not the surly encounters we had at the luxury hotel.   I have often stayed in Travelodge,  they have always provided a perfectly acceptable standard and excellent staff,  but this one is well above usual standards.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

We had dinner in the hotel (and breakfast the next day) and we simply couldn’t fault it: simple, very well cooked and tasty.

"We booked this hotel as we were getting an early Gatwick flight the following morning and this was the cheapest hotel in the area (£50 for the night). The room was pleasant and the staff were warm and welcoming. Mostly, the hotel would have been fine, if it hadn't been for a few issues   •Location, you could take a shuttle bus (£4 pp) from the terminal to get to the airport or a taxi for more. In the morning we got a taxi from the hotel for £6 - which was a good price to me •Bar was inflated. It costs about £5 a pint and £2 for a small packet of crisps!  •Wifi cost extra, £3 for 24 hours •Cleanliness, I noticed that in the bathroom there were several hairs around the base of the toilet  Overall, if you're staying for a flight at Gatwick, get a hotel on the airport site because","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

Bed comfortable, good bathroom facilities. Quiet.  The staff were friendly and welcoming. Very helpful. The frequent bus service to the airport is  useful - currently £4 an adult each way - good to have right change. Children free. Even at 2am it was every 30 minutes.  The breakfast buffet is extensive and of superior quality to the usual stuff on offer. Branded baked beans, sausages that tasted as though they contained meat, nice bacon and scrambled egg made from free range British eggs. Coffee could do with improving though.

"I booked a night at the travelodge because I had an early flight, because it's about 0.5 miles from the North Terminal and was reasonably priced.  The rooms are good, spacious and clean. The air-con is set to either heat or cool and is controlled by the reception, when I stayed it was set to heat and I asked them to change it to change it to cool (which they happily did).  Food and drinks are available at the hotel and there is only other hotels or a garage nearby.  A free transit service runs between the various hotels and Gatwick airport north and south terminals and runs virtually 24 hours a day. A timetable is kept at reception.  It is walkable (0.5 miles) to the north terminal, albeit part of the way along a dual carriageway without any pavements.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"If you are traveling at night do not depend on the shuttle service that the hotel advertises. It is not run by them, but the city or airport. Sometimes one of the buses just doesn't show for hours. The phone number of the front desk, and not useless central reservations, is impossible to find. Then if you talk to the staff expect a dismissive and defensive attitude. It's crazy to me that this was at the end of bike packing through central Europe for a month, but was the most dangerous, frustrating, and troublesome part of the whole trip.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

I was asked if I would like to pre-book one for the morning for which I promptly replied yes. The booking sheet was almost full so I can only imagine that the taxi company does a roaring amount of trade from the hotel.  The room itself is spacious and clean, with lovely power shower!

"We stayed here recently, just for a couple of nights. It was not planned in advance but we found it very easy to book last minute.  Location is great, just a few minutes from the airport by shuttle bus (walking is probably not an option especially with bags due to the road/mororway traffic). Ulimited breakfast is definitely worth it. Dinner and drinks can work out quite costly if you were to go for that option, but they do have offers on ie. Happy Hour or 2 Course Meal for approx £15.00pp. Staff were friendly, rooms were clean and comfortable. Worth staying should you need somewhere close to the airport for 1 or 2 nights.

Even the air con was simple to use and the t.v. was the right size for the room,controls easy. After a pleasant meal in the restaurant , generously sized portions, tasty, I retired for a very comfortable long night’s rest in a quiet and seemingly totally safe atmosphere.

The style of the restaurant isnt very pleasant , it may be attempting to be modern but its really quite stark.  Staff were all great at reception and restaurant. Just one unhelpful man bun on reception when looking for a cash point as theirs was out of order - go to the garage over the way - in fact the hotel next door (about 50 yards has one) It would have been nice to know instead of treking to the garage in the heat to find its cashpoint was also o.o.o.

We came for 1 day and were going to stay in London. Forget that. We got nights for 1/4 the price of London and the rooms were larger cleaner and all we had to do was spend 30 minutes on the train direct to London Victoria.  We saved so much money.  If you are like us.  We have two young kids and train tennis 4 hours a day and we are out early and back late.  We just needed a clean room and make it simple attitude. They did just that.  As a docotr who asks and demands cleanliness this hotel was cleaner than the hotels in downtown London.  The kk eh we spent we used at Winbledon where we were for 2 weeks.

"Worst hotel I've ever stayed in. Not only was the soap/shampoo dispenser in shower empty...but who uses the same product for body wash & shampoo? Wi-Fi was only good for 2 people (our 2 teens were disappointed). Had to pay extra for the shuttle to airport - was expecting it to be included. We were too tired to walk 20 minutes to the nearest restaurant, so ate at the hotel - big mistake - overpriced crappy microwaved frozen food. Doors too thin to block out sounds from hallway. Beds were uncomfortable.  ","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

Overnight stay with a party of 11. Rooms comfortable and clean. We decided to eat an evening meal in the cafe on ground floor. Extremely busy due to an off loaded delayed flight which meant kitchen and waiting staff were pushed to capacity. There was a delay on the food wait time but we were more than compensated by Sarah ( the Supervisor) and her excellent and hardworking team of staff who offered us all Complimentary drinks from the bar and desserts.  Excellent value and the gratuitous food and drinks were very much appreciated by our large party.  Many thanks - Great service in difficult circumstances.

Very clean hotel which has an on site restaurant and bar serving a good range of food, but a little pricy, but with nothing close by if you're hungry you pay the prices.  Good selection for breakfast in the morning with cereal, continental, and cooked available on an all you can eat basis, really good value.

"The ideal place to stay if you need an overnight stay at Gatwick airport. Only a few minutes from the terminals, spotless, great staff, and the shuttle bus runs all night. The rooms are bright and modern with everything you need. The biggest bonus is that there has obviously been a lot of thought to reducing noise, all the doors close quietly and the rooms appear to be sound proofed.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"Before I make my complaint, I just want to make it clear that the short woman with blond highlights wearing a white shirt working behind the bar tonight (I assume she was in charge) was rushed off her feet running around and working very hard. However she was let down by staff not having a clue what they were doing.   Firstly, behind the bar a young man stopped serving customers because he needed to change the best ceg. However after running around for ten minutes (not serving anyone) looking for a key or card or something, he then admitted to his boss that he didnt know how to change the ceg, so she had to do it for him.

But in the end, this hotel is a very high turnover place whose management doesn’t care about their guests’ experiences, as they know you’re just passing through for one night. During my first stay, on my way to Scotland for vacation, the room stank badly, so I mentioned it to the manager. There was a man in front of me at the desk complaining about the same thing. The manager passed it off as “the chemicals that are used to clean the room” and recommended that I “whack the a/c on and it’ll clear in no time.” Well, it didn’t because it was the putrid shower curtain that has never seen a washing machine and was growing mold.

"In my experience, most airport hotels, unless very expensive ones (and sometimes even they), are not very good: this one does better than those. The hotel has a very large number of rooms, so I am not sure how much the experience varies depending on what room you get. The room size is surprisingly not very small, the TV set has all the channels, there is nice air-conditioning that one can choose to switch on (though the temperature control on it doesn't work, so if you want it, you will have to have 24 degrees Celsius), and there are some instant coffee/tea options there in the room.

The bathroom had a general smell of stale urine too. We stayed one night and in the morning we both had several bites on our legs. We presume these are from the bed.  When we checked in, we had to call the reception staff over from the back room after waiting a few minutes.

"We stayed at this hotel the night before flying from Gatwick North Terminal. We chose a non-flexi room for two adults and one child (no breakfast) and the cost was £46.00.  Checking in was fast and onsite car park was £8 for 24 hours.  Bar and restaurant area was huge. Lots of staff milling about but not many behind the bar. They failed to tell us that their chef had not turned up so a pretty restricted menu got even smaller after this fact and they could only offer a pizza or panini.   We decided to drive 5 mins up the road to the Premier Inn and the staff there were great, didn't charge us to park in their car park and menu 100 times better than the Travelodge.

"The hotel was perfect for our overnight stay for my husband and two grandchildren, beds very comfy, lovely pillows , lovely white bed linen and large towels, good shower and bathroom facilities. we ate in the cafe bar which was good if slightly expensive, the drinks were pricey but as we were on the eve of our holiday ""what the heck"" We had an early start to get to the airport the staff member booked us a taxi when we checked in, which turned up ont time and the driver was helpful. All in all we had a good short stay, staff were pleasant and helpful and to the great relief of the kids 11 and 15 the wi fi worked well ! We would go back there again without a doubt.

Very adequate accommodation and food. Nothing to complain about and we would happily return for another visit. It is some miles from the airport so we arranged a taxi service when we got to the airport from the railway station. The roads and junctions are complex so a taxi service is convenient and preferable we thought to the shuttle.,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"What a start to our holiday.  £5.95 for a bottle of London pride, advertised as 500 ml, only to be served 330 ml. Rip off, then £10.95 for the worst most tasteless burger ive ever eaten. Thank god im off to Texas. Will not use this chain ever again. These hotels trade off the fact, you're already here. Another example of dumming down to the lowest acceptable level.

"Good value for money. Staff friendly. Took about 20 minutes from the Travelodge to South Terminal at 7am. Restaurant is more like a canteen - not cozy and actually quite cold in there, but the food was good compared to similar hotels (very nice quinoa salad, and pizza was more generous than some) and staff were friendly.

We took the shuttle bus from Gatwick having arrived there by train ahead of a very early flight the next morning. Had a decent enough meal in the restaurant in the evening but as someone coming down from “up North” the bar prices are scandalous. We also enjoyed a good all-you-can eat breakfast before taking a taxi arranged by Reception back to Gatwick Airport (actually cheaper than the shuttle bus for 2 people). Overall a nice clean hotel with friendly staff and we will stop there again if we fly out from Gatwick again. There is a huge Tesco within a few minutes’ walk if you’ve forgotten anything (or if the hotel bar prices have terrified you). I couldn’t find the TV remote but someone arrived with another one within 5 minutes of me asking.

Used self check in as reception was busy. Lots of wasted space in the room. Very minimal. The bed sheets had quite a few stains on them and hairs. Would have expected nice bright clean sheets for a hotel. The shower did not have much pressure and didn’t get very hot. The shower curtain had a large yellow stain on it and did not really keep the water inside the shower. It just helped make the floor a pool. The drain didn’t really work fast enough. The water was close to flowing over. It was ok value for money but prefer the premier inn which was the same price and much more consistent with the room quality. ,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Lodging ant Travelodge has never been a problem.  I have never been disappointed in any respect and on many occasions have enjoyed an experience above and beyond that which they advertise.  Having pre-booked, I arrived at 0200 in the morning to be cheerfully greeted, room upgraded and quickly directed to my room.  Room in perfect order in every respect.  Brief refamiliarization with the aircon/climate control box and then to bed in a wonderfully comfortable bed.  Next morning at the Desk, 10 seconds to checkout with helpful staff inviting comment or criticism and ready with bus times or taxi requests.  Absolutely great.  I truly believe that this chain offers the BEST value for money accommodation.  I didn't stay for breakfast on this occasion .

"This hotel says on its  web site that there is a shuttle bus from Gatwick Airport but then explains in the small pront that there is not.  There is simply a hotel transfer bus which lots of hotels use and it charges 4 pounds per person each way.  But who reads the small print?  Consequently, when you wait and watch the other hotels' mini bus shuttles you wait in vain for one from the Travelodge, even though the inforrmation at the bus stop says there is one available ""on request"" (nobody answers the 'phone when you do try to telephone and request a shuttle anyway).  This is false advertising that borders on deception.  There are no telephones in the rooms, so it is bad luck if a friend visits but you cannot be contacted in your room and told that they have arrived.

"A short walk or taxi ride from Gatwick North, this hotel is often a good bit cheaper than the on-concourse ones.  Recently refurbished and a lot more comfortable than the Premier Inn A23 IMHO, you are well placed to walk into Horly for a variety of restaurants (10 - 15 minutes).  The recent hike in car parking (now £16 per day) are, however, a reason to stay away - or find on-street parking a shortish walk away.  You can walk here along the Sussex/Surry Border path if its daylight and not too wet - in about 10-15 minutes, or use Evo Cars (£6) which is a lot cheaper than the £4 pp shuttle bus.  You can also get here by local service bus a lot cheaper.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

The Travelodge is the other side of a car park behind the old Premier Inn.  It's close to North Terminal and if there was a path to the hotel it would be very easy to walk to.  The only way to get there on foot however is along the dual carriageway which is pretty terrifying.  I know there's a bus (4 quid each way) but in the interests of lowering carbon footprints a path from just behind that car park is a no brainer.  ,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Stayed here for a grand total of 5 hours overnight between flights. The room was adequately clean and spacious, with well stocked tea and coffee facilities and a comfortable bed (which I'd have liked to spend more time in). The only downside was there was no hairdryer in the room. It does state this on the booking confirmation email. Of course, I didn't bother to read that, and wasted the time it would have taken me to get one from Reception on searching obscure areas of the room hoping one would turn up inside the spare pillow or under the bed.

It cannot be controlled indivdually - reception makes the settings for a block of rooms. I wanted cool air - and got hot. At other times it would not come on at all.

The Room! We was at the back on a ground floor We had a kettle no coffee or sugar the room was very small. On going to bed as we had an early flight we had what we think staff outside talking very loudly outside. The room was boiling hot air con did not work so we went to open the window on pulling back the curtains THERE WAS NO WINDOW it was blacked out and couldn’t open it, all not there was running water in a pipe in our bathroom.

"We had a one night stay here to be close at hand for an early morning flight out of Gatwick.  We booked a super room and it was great value for money on the advance rate. Everything was clean and new, check in was fast and friendly and efficient.  A super room has a few more frills, a proper coffee machine and tea/coffee, ironing board and iron and bigger TV. All in good order.  A taxi from the train station is £11 and the shuttle to the airport couldn't be more convenient, stopping right outside and calling at just one other hotel before South then North terminal.  We've avoided Gatwick in the past but if I have an early flight there again I will definitely chose the Travelodge for the value.

It was excellent in all ways and the breakfast was as good if not better than I had experienced in very expensive hotels around the world.  Excellent value  The staff were also very helpful. I'll use the hotel again in the future, as this is a regular trip.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"I stayed at this hotel for the first time back in June before a 7am flight the following day.  Check in was smooth and my room was big and spacious and very clean.   I visited the bar which had a lovely atmosphere and was decorated with a clean, modern feel. I only had a couple of drinks and didn’t eat, so cannot comment on the food.   I had a peaceful nights sleep and woke up early to use the shuttle bus which stops right outside the hotel. The busses are frequent and you can obtain a timetable from reception. They are very punctual and stop at a few hotels along the way, going to either the north or south terminal.   All in all a good stay at this hotel, with good online prices and I would definitely stay again. ","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

If your looking for a place to stay near Gatwick airport this place is very convenient.  There is a shuttle bus that goes round the neighboring hotels and takes you to both north Terminal and south terminal.

"I really don't know why people are shocked by £16 car parking fee. The charge is clearly stated on there website. As it happens we stayed last night and the machine was broken  so didn't have to pay. Food was ok, 2 courses for £14, drinks London prices. There's a co op, which is an 8 minute walk if you want drinks etc, for your room. Room was immaculate, staff were very friendly. Hope it's as good on our return. And if the parking machine could still be broken even better 👍","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

Great location close to Gatwick North long stay carpark.  Stayed with friends as we had an early flight the next morning.  We had rooms on the first floor which was a bit of a walk and had to use the stairs as there was no lift in that part of the hotel.  Okay for us as we had small suitcases but could see this may be awkward for older guests with large cases.  Room clean and bed comfortable.  Didn’t eat in the restaurant so can’t comment on the food.  Walls are a bit thin and we had annoying neighbours who were laughing loudly at 2 in the morning.  Would stay again if having an early morning flight.,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

Queue building and no effort to open another terminal. Room very nice on 2nd floor, having unpacked we discovered the air conditioning had a fault and turned itself off every 10 minutes......solution to get a heater from reception as no person could fix. Watching TV only to find remote was faulty........solution to get a replacement remote from reception only to find that didn’t work either.

Catarina told us not to worry she would sort everything out. Were we taken in the bar area and given a free cup of tea whilst it was being sorted out. Catarina returned to say she had arranged a room for us but it would be an extra £22 which we were more than happy to pay as i booked a non refunable room and it was my fault.

"This Travel Lodge is a great place to overnight in before flying from Gatwick. It is clean, tidy and comfortable. It has a bar and a breakfast if needed, although I tend to eat at the airport as I often have to leave early. The hotel is also very reasonably priced and there is most often availability. A couple of small criticisms is that the hotel carpark is expensive - £16 for the night with no option to pay less. Also, the hotel can be difficult to find as the Sat Nav does not show exactly where it is. You need to travel down a road which looks like you're going the wrong way and then you suddenly see a turning to your left.  You can see the hotel from quite far, but it's difficult to work out how to get there if you arrive after dark.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

Great value hotel with large well-carpeted and sound proof room overlooking woods. Very comfy bed. It is only 15 minutes walk from North Terminal to Hotel.

Also the hand soap was empty and a very small amount of toilet paper in the bathroom, these are things that should be checked after every stay. Unfortunately we have two more stays booked but after that we shall stay elsewhere.

This is the third Travelodge I’ve stayed at and just like the other two I felt shortchanged. My room was in dire need of some cleaning (mud on the carpet right at the entrance which could easily be seen by housekeeping so not sure how it stayed there.), bathroom had mold (seems to be a common problem because I had to have my room changed and both rooms had this issue).

I thought it might have been a one of, but have been to other Travelodges and this seems to be the norm. I think they need a lot more training in  Quality of presentation . Me personally I would not put up with this quality of standard .","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"I like to use the Travelodge chain of hotels. They are reasonably priced, no frills hotels with comfortable beds in clean rooms. There was a kettle with a selection of tea bags and instant coffees in the room. Hanging space and a TV. All the basics you'd need.  A bus ran from the hotel to the airport at a cost of £4 making it a handy place to stay if flying from Gatwick.  I'd happily stay there again.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Expensive bus trip, £4 each way for such a short trip is very dear. Room door was wide open when i got there and the previous guest had clearly been sick due to thesmell which i  fairness the cleaners did a fair job for covering the smell.  Avoid the restaurant its rubbish and service is dreadful. Head 8nto Horley for food and drinks is my suggestion.  Ill think more tha  twice before booking again.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"I chose the Travel Lodge as it’s close to the airport and the price for one night was better compared with other hotels in the area. The hotel was recently refurbished and you feel that as soon as you walk in reception. My room all seemed very new and clean. The bed was very comfortable - I slept well! The shower was hot and powerful, though bathroom a little small. Coffee/tea making facilities in the room was a nice touch, in the standard room there is no hairdryer (you can borrow free from reception) however I think it would be great to have a hairdryer in all rooms as standard. I chose to pay extra for the unlimited buffet breakfast in the morning - a nice selection of freshly cooked food plus tea, coffee and juices.

Good points: - close to Gatwick (£6 for a taxi or £4 for the shuttle bus)  - nice open plan area at the bar / kitchen  - can check yourself in using the machines  Bad points: - room was ridiculously hot and the aircon unit would not change to the “cool” setting. After hours of struggling to sleep I eventually went down to reception to moan and all they had to do was press a button (from reception) and the aircon was working in my room. Not sure why you have to request to use the aircon..  - shower was terrible  - room smelt... probably because all of the windows are locked so no fresh air comes in - took us ages to find our room!!! Room 160 is not easy to find and the signs should state you need to walk up the stairs! Not good when you have 2 heavy suitcases each..  - parking,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

On arrival I was having problems paying for parking (£16 for 24 hours, which felt extortionate given we would be parking for less than 10 hours), so went inside to ask how the machine worked.  The young chap on reception suggested using the machine inside the hotel and came out from behind the counter to help.  Ticket purchased and placed on car and then I was able to check-in.  Check-in was efficient and when I was given the key I checked we had a family room and received confirmation it was.

"I booked the travelodge following a late flight. I checked the cost of coaches/trains to my home city and due to the exceptional pricing of the hotel it worked out to be cheaper to stay overnight and then travel the following day.  The room was large and comfortable with good facilities and, like every Travelodge, the mattress was heavenly!

We decided to stay at Gatwick Central for a flight the following morning.  The ground floor foyer and bar/lounge is amazing.  Not a typical travelodge and gives the impression of a 4 star hotel.  Very clean hotel and with modern facilities.  There is a large paid car park at the front where you could leave your car for the entire holiday and  a shuttle bus to the airport terminals.  Room was spacious and clean with excellent bathroom.  There were two large stains on the bedroom carpet.  Beds and linen as to be expected from Travelodge so their usual high standards.  The air con/ heating would stop every few minutes but I did not report this as we were staying one night. As our young daughter had a cough we were particularly concerned.  The best Travelodge I have stayed at ever! ,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"This hotel is conveniently situated for Gatwick Airport and excellent value for money. I found the staff both courteous and helpful. The hotel also has a restaurant and bar.

We mentioned it to reception the next day, but didn't leave a bad review because we've stayed at this and other Travelodges before and usually find them excellent. However, this time, I had a really bad night's sleep. The heating wouldn't go above 22 degrees (you may think this is fine, and I just got under the covers so no problem). The problem was, it went off completely in the night (according to reception, it always goes off when the temperature reaches a certain level, don't know what the level is because no-one told me of this when I checked in.)

People were still going back to their rooms while the alarm was going off and before the fire brigade arrived but no one from Travelodge stopped them from doing this.

And could hear the person next door taking their shower.  And some rooms on the first floor aren’t accessible via an elevator. They have a `second’ first floor, which requires you to walk down a long corridor and up some stairs. That’s fine if you don’t have suitcases with you!  Overall, great value.

The hotel is a quarter of the price you would pay if you stayed in the terminal hotels. The rooms and beds are comfortable and the only drawback is that free wifi is only available for a short period of time.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"I stayed 3 nights whilst working away from home over Christmas. Being able to bring my dogs made it much more bearable! The bed was very comfy and staff were great, especially when I had a minor panic because I'd left my phone at work and didn't have an alarm clock (the TV has an alarm function). ","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
The hotel itself is good. It is not as near to the airport as I thought. There is a shuttle at £4pp and a taxi is £12. This is all extra expense especially if there are a few people together. As there is a premier Inn within wslking distance this is the easiest option so to tempt people to stay at the travel lodge it should be cheaper to get there. ,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

What a wonderful hotel. Clean comfortable and luxurious all for a very low cost. Upon departing we encountered a pilot checking out. I think that says it all. The only downside is the cost of the shuttle bus but that is hardly the fault of this wonderful hotel,"Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
"Typical Travelodge ideal for overnight stay pre flight. I used public transport to LGW and then the bus service to Hotel @ £4pp per journey, not great with luggage and fellow travellers.

Evacuated due to fire alarm. Very poor evacuation proceedures. Am concerned if they ever have a real fire. Love this hotel but will never stay here again due to my concerns. Will stay at other hotels nearby. Would like to know if they called fire service straight away. Took long time to arrive.   Also dont let them put you on 6th floor. My arthritic knees and back didnt like the stairs. Also wonder why they put people in wheelchairs on 6th floor.

"The staff was friendly and helpful, the room clean but really small, the bed was fine.  The shower had a short curtain that did not contain the water well, and on top of that the shower drain was clogged, so it quickly leaked out onto the bathroom floor.  I think even if the drain was not clogged, the curtain was inadequate.  Also, only 30 minutes of free wifi, then you had to pay.

The ac didn't turn down so the room was unbearably stuffy The windows are all locked shut at Travelodges. We had a 4 a.m start but didn't get any sleep because we couldn't breath! It defeated the whole point of staying near to the airport. The staff said they'd fixed the problem from reception but nothing changed and we continued to not sleep until it was time to leave.

The taxi service, EVO, is the best way to get back and fore if there are a number of you.They charged 6 pounds for three of where the bus would have cost 12 pounds.  Restaurant was very noisy  with kids whose parents had no control over. Food and drinks are expensive, typical for a hotel. I went to a local pub, 6 pound taxi ride for three of us ""ye Old Six Bells""   good drinks and food there.  I've stayed at the hotel many times, this was the first  time that I  was forced to leave due to the noise.  The service score  was average due too staff not being able to stop the kids misbehaving.

We have used this hotel on numerous occasions and parked overnight. Stayed here again and parking charges were £16 for 24 hours which when you are only parking for 8 hours is in my opinion extortionate. When we parked here previously it was around £8.

Room was clean and spacious. Bathroom was fresh and had a good shower.  My rate also included wifi and breakfast all for around £55. Only complaint would be the Breakfast, which was a serve yourself,  was all a little dried out.  Nice good, but just felt had been left out a bit too long.  Would certainly look to stay there again if I needed too.   Note, parking for guests was £16 for 24 hours. ","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

Hotel was adequate for the price however the parking cost of a minimum of £16 is outrageous. Mostly because this isn’t stated when you book the room.  Ridiculous cost for 11 hours overnight parking.

However the travelodge app/ website states that there are often discounts available for guests if asked for at reception, we were only staying at the hotel for 8 hours paid which o explained and thought this would mean we would be eligible - unfortunately not we still had to pay a basic rate of £16 for 24 hours, this is almost as much as the room cost me! You are unable to pay for any less, this seems a bit silly seen as plenty of people must use it as a short pit stop.

"Although the hotel is very close to the North Terminal, if you want to get to it on foot you'd better have sturdy footwear (filthy, muddy puddles) and a hi-vis vest in your luggage (walking along the northbound A23 in the dark is not much fun). The alternative is a ripoff GBP4 each way transfer bus. Don't forget to make sure you have the right coins!  In my room, the sink plug was in and could not be removed. An alternative room was not offered. I would be ok with this in a Youth Hostel, but in a business-style hotel I don't think this is acceptable.  The bed was reasonably comfortable, but there was constant noise coming from the A23, and although I am not a light sleeper I found it quite difficult to sleep well (I was in the annexe, I don't know it the main building is","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"Was put here for two nights after flight cancellations with easy jet. So was not happy upon arrival.   The hotel itself, and the bedrooms in particular, were extremely clean, and well decorated. So it’s obviously well kept by the staff who currently run it.   The staff were really friendly and welcoming. And dealt with the cancellations, which easy jet had dumped on them, with a calm and collected attitude. Jez and the rest of the team at the front desk working over the weekend are an invaluable asset.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"The hotel is literally 2/4 minutes away from Gatwick North Terminal and is so easily convenient to get to with the airport transfer buses. The staff at the hotel are superb and its extremely clean. Outside can sometimes be a little loud but I think that depends where in the hotel you are as we've stayed before in a different area and it was so quiet! You can get some loud guests but overall it's a decent hotel, especially for the price and if it's just a stop over.","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

"My stay at this Travelodge was by far one of the best. The customer service throughout my stay by an employee who went by the name of Vini, was really fantastic. From when we entered the hotel, he made sure that everything was going smoothly, allocating us to our room for the day, to providing us with options for food and so on until it was time for us to leave. Usually employees would do what they think is essential to do, however Vini done that and also went an extra mile to make sure we really had a fantastic stay. I really appreciate the service Vini provided and will definitely be recommending family and friends to stay at this Travelodge if they are close by and in need of a hotel. Keep it up! 10/10 :)","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

I tried to raise these complaints to reception in the morning. Unfortunately she wouldn’t listen to all of it, choosing to talk over me instead.   There are plenty of places to stay over in Gatwick. I would not recommend this one. ","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor

We had great service when we arrived at 08:30pm with two sleeping children. Juan(not sure if correct spelling) greeted us at reception. Because of our sleeping children he helped carry our bags to the room. He also then asked if he could book us a taxi to airport for the next day.

"As normal now the rooms are really good but do lack a few nice touches.......heating that actually worked for more than 15 minutes would be really good, I complained so many times it’s ridiculous. The room heats up then it goes cold so you have to turn on again, it’s a repetitive and not conducive to a good nights sleep.  The breakfasts are truly horrible, £9.99 for cold food, the hash brown, sausages and scrambled eggs are tasteless, over cooked and hard......you could use to break windows. The bacon floppy tasteless. Oh my god the fruit juices, these taste like coloured water. There is nothing good about breakfast, it was a really an embarrassment as we had invited family to join us.

He even took a drinks order from our table to save me bringing the children to the bar!  Another shout out to Ben. Very friendly and interacted with my children in the bar and cafe giving them a high 5 and having a short conversation. A nice extra touch especially for a 2.5 year old.

"Great location and handy shuttle bus service to and from the airport with not a long waiting time. We stayed in a Super Family Room, which is spacious and perfect for a family. The Lavazza coffee machine was a great addition. The room was surprising quiet given it's location which meant we had a great night sleep. The breakfast was a nice and varied buffet. The dinner menu was excellent and had lots of choice to cover everyone. The only negatives were the venting in the bathroom, it must have venting near a staff/customer smoking area as occasionally the bathroom would stink of cigarette smoke, also the shower had a shower curtain which I always find a bit grim. But I would stay here again, as these were only slight negatives. ","Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central, Horley, Surrey, England",trip_advisor
After a weekend in London we stayed here as we had an early flight in the morning. A late check-in at 10 pm but no issues and while restaurant was just closing the bar was still open which suited us.

Just a tip, the connecting shuttle bus to the to the terminals cost £4 per person, go by taxi and it is £6 flat fare, whether there are one, two or three of you. £12 if you have a lot of luggage.
